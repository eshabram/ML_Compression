I thought I was twisting off the cover for the light but it was for the electrical connection to the entire light part of the fan. Can this be repaired (by a professional) or do we need a whole new fan? Feeling very silly!

Need Some Serious Help and Advice My wife and I moved back to the US (Texas) in the early 2020s and picked the place we did for the neighborhood / school / etc . Our house came with an unpermitted (unbeknownst to us and apparently known to everyone in the neighborhood) addition of about 400 square feet. The addition was built ontop of what looks to be a pre-existing outdoor patio (pics for details). We had a mini-split installed in the addition as it got a lot of sun and the main AC seemed to struggle to regulate temperature / moisture in there.

About 2 years into our ownership of the house, we noticed the flooring beginning to separate and almost dry out. Shortly there after, it started to smell musty, at which point we pulled the rugs we laid down to find mildew forming along the seems of the floorboards. We pulled a few of the planks to find that the flooring was built on top of industrial carpet that was glued directly to the previous outdoor patio floor. We had been through a number of  rain storms and observed the outside patio was not properly draining either and the water would pool along the base of the exterior wall and outside thresh. As the threshold began to dry out, dry rot began to form.

Clearly a myriad of issues to solve for and I want to start solving them, but I don't want them coming back. I've had numerous contractors come through and none of them could give me a definitive solution. All of them give some short term solution like "We can replace the flooring" but obviously, that doesn't stop it from happening again the future. I'm open to any number of ideas and a combination of solves to make it a permanent fix. My thought is to take it issue by issue, starting with the pooling water against the outside threshold and then working my way in to solve the other issues.

I'd be keen to cut the outside patio and remove it (not only to avoid water pooling, but also cause i just dont care for it). I also considered just skipping the flooring by pulling the floorboards and pouring concrete over it.

Looking for ideas or advice - I can't seem to get any contractor to figure out a full solution that isn't a band-aid hitjob.

Thank you in advance!

Acoustic foam in ductwork to quiet air return? Just bought a new house and discovered that the air return for the first floor is very loud. I‚Äôve taken a look at it and done some web searches, but before I commit to a solution I wanted to get some advice here!

I removed the air return grate and found that it‚Äôs pretty much a straight shot to the fan, maybe 3 feet with only a minor bend downward. I can literally see the fan moving when I take off the air return grate.

I noticed that there is a gap inside the ductwork between the fan and where the duct attaches, which is allowing the air that is being sucked in by the fan to reverberate inside of the unit. I believe that this is the cause of the noise.

1) I think that my solution is to buy acoustic foam and stick it inside the ductwork. I should be able to reach far back enough to line most of it and this wouldn‚Äôt impede airflow. I am seeing that acoustic foam is porous, so I could maybe even put it directly in the grate opening and see what happens apoens.

2) I did see another possible solution of getting a soundproof blanket or curtain and putting it over the grate, but I don‚Äôt want to impede airflow and want to avoid a solution that is potentially an eyesore.

My only worry with solution #1 is that, since the ductwork is so short, it may not dampen the noise enough. If so, I am wondering if putting some more foam inside of the fan compartment in the garage, where the noise is originating, would be safe? I wouldn‚Äôt put it near any wires or moving parts if I did so.

Any input is appreciated, thanks!
Can a home settle differentially without the foundation cracking 
My house has a slope in the floors from the high point at the center of the house, to low points on the outside walls. The high point seems to consistently follow a steel center beam that in the basement has a post attached to the floor. The post is concreted into the floor and bolted into the beam. 

I ripped out the finished walls in the basement and found out that they have no serious cracking (super tiny hairline, can‚Äôt even slip a dollar bill in between) and are pretty much plumb/level. The thing I‚Äôm curious is, could the house have settled differentially but the post stayed at the original height and pushed the house up in the center and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs got a slope to the floor?

Mother-in-law‚Äôs house, how in trouble is she? 
I was told I must post when I finished my first flagstone project. Yo, it‚Äôs not perfect, but I‚Äôm happy with it. It‚Äôs also not totally complete (gonna regrade the gravel/dirt by the ‚Äúcurve‚Äù). Since it‚Äôs DIY I just plan to slowly keep compacting, filling chip rock as needed through the summer and whatnot. 

I did this pretty cheap. I bought flagstone that was less than half the price of nice 2‚Äù stuff and it was quite variable.. some pieces as thick as 4-5‚Äù. Just kinda angle grinded my way through my free time. I‚Äôm taking a chisel here and there to edges that don‚Äôt look natural from the angle grinder and whatnot.

Overall, I‚Äôm pretty happy and so is my fianc√©! 

Back on the other side of the garage I will do another 250sqft this summer for a grilling area by the pool bar we made out of the shed (recently ran electric, installed fridge and bought some cool pieces for the bar). I‚Äôll hopefully take some lessons I learned forward from that.

Thanks for the help from people who responded to my initial questions!

Home in plastic shingle siding How do I fix a small hole in plastic shingle like siding?
Is this normal? I had my wood siding repaired and repainted on my 100+ year old home in February of this year. It had looked fine for the most part until a couple of weeks ago but this Texas summer seems to have taken its toll.

Wasps in Home Hi!

I recently purchased a 1949 cape cod. As pictured, there is a gable vent that extends to a space that is attic-esque on the side of the sloped wall on the second floor. This space is basically a triangular straightaway between the two upstairs bedrooms and is about 30 feet long. 

The second picture is the door in the bedroom that leads to this space. 

I can see wasps entering the gable vent frequently. I assume there nest is somewhere in there. This has lead to a few wasps entering through the bedroom.

I am afraid of wasps so I have screwed down that door in the bedroom and added t-shirts to the bottom to seal off as much as I can. I plan to caulk and put mounding around the bottom to permanently seal this area off.

I am seeking advice on how to stop the problem.

Would a mesh cover on the vent work, or will that only drive them into the house more?
Should I spray the shit out of the vent with long-range wasp spray?
What is this and can I seal it off?

Listen i dont know whats going on and if im crazy So lately a lot of things have been moving in the house, like a spray bottle on the bathroom floor, and my weed disappeared. I was chill about it, thought it might be the cats or something. Until a few days ago, my pills gone missing. I thought the cats played with them and let it go. This morning, i woke up, the pills were not on the counter still. But when i went back to my room they were there. I panicked and screamed and call my landlord. She suggested to check everywhere where a person could hide (small 2 bedroom apartment so not much place) and then when there was no one we hung up. I went to the counter in the living room to get a banana and suddenly the pills were beside me. I screamed and ran away, knocking on the doors of all the building, vut no one answered. I called the cops, they say they wont help. I dont know what to do!

Edit - my neighbors came back home, i ordered a new camera, changed the cylinder and my mom is on video call with me all night long. Also i checked myself with a psychiatrist and he said im fine :) i highly doubt memory loss because the psychiatrist said its highly unlikely. Also, and im sorry to disappoint you, i doubt the carbon monoxide thing because i have no gas in any form at home. Everything's electric:)

What to do about floors I recently bought a house from the 1930s that has hardwood floors. The floors really need to be redone, but I just can‚Äôt afford it right now (too many other things that need to be done). I have rugs down right now, but I was wondering what are your thoughts on putting a floating floor over the hardwood. My reasoning is that this wouldn‚Äôt cost me as much as redoing the floors, it would help preserve the hardwood, and it could be pulled up when I have the money to get the hardwood refinished (or new owners could pull it up and redo the hardwood, if I decide to sell down the road).  Is this a good solution? By the way, I have two elderly dogs and don‚Äôt want them to damage newly redone hardwood or make it any worse.

Is this a carpenter ant? Here is what the ants look like: [https://ibb.co/JzG7GwB](https://ibb.co/JzG7GwB) I'm not really sure they are carpenter ants, imo. But husband is convinced they are.

Note the three stripes on their abdomen, but they are wingless. They have been making holes in the caulk in our kitchen. We saw a bunch a week ago in our rice bags (they were not sealed) and 2-3 days ago because some chicken scraps were left on the counter. Yesterday I put down terro and they disappeared. Last year we had the same problem, and terro took care of it within a week. Husband insists we still call professionals this time because "carpenter ants will destroy the wood in our house".

Leak from Roof Attic Exhaust Previous homeowner put on a new roof and shingled over the flashing for an existing attic exhaust fan 15 yrs ago. Likely the work of "I know a guy DIY handyman wannabe".  
  
They sealed up the new shingles around the fan with some roofing tar and called it a day. The roofing tar has finally failed and I now have some water intrusion. Replacing a fan that looks like it's 20-30+ yrs old should be pretty straightforward.  
  
But, problem is that water also caused the sheathing underneath to deteriorate - but mostly downhill from the fan itself between the two trusses.  
  
Is an acceptable temporary repair to cut a sheet of plywood to fit between the two trusses - and 'sister' it to the existing sheathing from underneath, and short it up with some 2x4's to the trusses to give some structure to the roof?  
  
The roof will have to be replaced in 10 years, but not ready to tear it all off just yet. The shingles are in good condition as is the rest of the roof. Trying to avoid the huge expense for a relatively small problem area.  
  
Thanks!

What kind of professional do I need for sinking ground? We moved into a new house last fall. Lots of stuff is still under warranty, and they regraded our backyard as a part of that. Heavy rains created a foot deep, 20 foot long trench. A lot of our neighbors had similar issues. Now the builder sent us a letter asking us to sign that the regrading work is done to our satisfaction. Feels suspicious, and I‚Äôm wondering what kind of professional I need to hire to inspect the ground and tell me what to mark while it‚Äôs still under warranty.

Where to put dehumidifier Hello, 

We moved into an older split level home in the Denver area that has a basement. It also doesn‚Äôt have central air but does have an evaporative(swamp) cooler mounted to the roof. 

That being said, we don‚Äôt mind the evaporative cooler as it costs substantially less to run than AC but it does lead to a few more bugs getting through our window screens. 

I bought a small dehumidifier to help with the humidity levels brought on by the cooler to help it function a little more efficiently. It actually works really well. 

However, I‚Äôm not sure if I have it in the right place. It‚Äôs on the main living level just below where the main vent for the evap comes in. I empty about 2 cups of water maybe every day and a half. 

So, should I place it where I have it or place into the basement area? Or, should I get a second one for the basement? 

I also have a cheap window a/c but I haven‚Äôt set it up yet since those are loud and use way more energy. But, if we have guests and they want it even colder in the guest room. 

Thanks!
How do it get the shower to go back to full flow? I tried pushing, sliding the button grip on top but it doesn‚Äôt go back to full flow, no shower!
Cedar closet has no drywall backing between itself and the attic. Also no insulation. How to remedy? so, we moved into this house in the spring and have found a delightful amount of stupid things the previous folks did. The walk in closet in an upstairs bedroom is all cedar, and looks great! But the closet's ceilling and two walls have attic on the other side. As the photos show below, the cedar has no drywall backing, and no insulation, so they whole thing is a giant leak of conditioned air into the attic and vice versa.   


We have some folks coming to give us a quote to add insulation to our attic anyway (other parts of the same attic only have 1-2" of rolled insulation that's very old). Is there any extra sealing we can do that would help? Either cutting adding drywall between the studs, or that spray foam insulation?  


(first photo shows what's accessible for the back of the closet. the closet continues past those uninsulated AC ducts (another fun story) Second photo shows closet's ceiling. )

Cleaning vinyl linoleum? Does anyone have tips for cleaning and old vinyl linoleum floor? Redoing isn't an option in the immediate future and it seems like sweep and mop don't cut it. There are parts I've scrubbed pretty hard that look much cleaner, I'll probably end up doing this for the whole floor but making a habit out of that seems like a sisyphean task.

Help understanding curtain situation? Recently purchased a condo, it has a curtain on the one track that spans 20 feet and meets in the middle, moving symmetrically with the pull string. It has a second plastic piece that does not have a track, but looks like it could be used for another curtain layer. It has no holes, and the side facing away from the window looks like it has velcro/something like Velcro. I'm not really sure what to call or how to describe either object that runs across the space in front of the window. It would be nice to be able to put up another layer of curtain since the existing one is mostly transparent, could someone explain what I'm looking at here?
Does this door look right? I got this PVC front door installed a year ago, but not sure the install was correct. It is multipoint: you lift the handle and 3 ‚Äúpucks‚Äù get lifted to secure the door.

Hidden Hardwood Floors? Hi all, I‚Äôm currently in escrow to buy a house, and while doing some poking around in it today, I found this in the bedroom closet.

The wood on the left is stamped and labeled as ‚ÄúCarpet Strip‚Äù, and has nails coming out of it. But it appears to be laying on top of another layer of wood, that looks like it might be original hardwood flooring? Or is it just more subflooring? I can‚Äôt rip anything up further to confirm my suspicions until we move in.

The front hallway has Parquet wood flooring, but the rest of the house is a mixture of carpet and vinyl.

Not an expert on this, so I could use a second opinion on what I‚Äôm seeing! Any help would be appreciated.

Frigidaire washer: PAU/E11 error and missing model/serial number We moved into a new place with Frigidaire stacked washer & dryer. Washer on bottom of stack has stopped working: if I start a wash cycle, it stops immediately and displays a PAU error on the display. Error code is E11. A technician looked into this and says it's the electrical board, but we can't find the model/serial number anywhere on the washer - we looked everywhere - so we can't even order the part to fix it.

1. Has anyone had similar PAU and E11 errors, and been able to fix it? How did you do it? Both inlet valve and water pressure (hot+cold) have been checked and are good.

2. Based on the pictures below, would you be able to tell me the model number of the washer? For reference, the dryer on top of stack (not pictured) is: Frigidaire 7.0 Cu. Ft. Gas Dryer, model number FFQG5000QW2. Both washer & dryer were very likely bought and installed together in 2014.

Thank you for any help. Much appreciated.

How To Fix Crack On Conrete Steps (Inside Corner) 
What type of flooring is this? Been at this apartment for a couple of months now and everytime we clean the floors, they seem to get dirtier. Just want to properly clean them according to the type of tiles they are.
Newly installed window, crack around frame We had this large (9‚Äô wide) window installed last year, the previous window was 90‚Äôs construction grade and was literally bending in the middle. Contractor expected to have to install a more sufficient header, but upon inspection the header was more than efficient. This window is much higher quality. Was re-caulking the side of the window today which has some minor cracks, then noticed the top of the window has a 1/8-1/4‚Äù crack between caulk and frame (photo 2 and 3).

Is this a simple re-caulk issue? Anything more to be concerned by?
Gap at top of door. What should I do? You can see that the door is leaning in the frame, so there‚Äôs a gap between the piping (which I replaced and is installed properly) and the door.

Frigidaire dryer belt repair Frigidaire dryer belt repair

Attempting to fix my dryer that broke recently, the belt that adheres to the drum isn‚Äôt catching and spinning like it should. 

I bought a new belt and put it on but it seems like I‚Äôm missing a piece or the set up configuration of the motor and the adjustable arm is off? They are basically overlapping and touching one another which doesn‚Äôt seem right. The belt also seems a little tight where I couldn‚Äôt get it to weave in between the motor and adjustable arm, I bought the correct model so not sure why. The originally band seemed to be an inch or so looser and hung out of place almost.


Hopefully someone with experience could point me in the right direction‚Ä¶ considering just calling a pro at this point but wasn‚Äôt ready to shell out ~$250 for a repair or ~$600 for an entire new dryer
Those with neighbors with a fence Does your neighbor weed eat along the fence line or do you have to do that?

I have to do this at my house. My dad has to do this at his house. I find it annoying bc their fence creates an extra thing for me to do. What I don't get is do fence owners not understand they should do this?

Need some feedback about garage issue Hi all, I‚Äôve got an issue with my garage, but I‚Äôm not sure how big of a problem it actually is. 

In 2020, I bought a 1950s home that has been torn down to the studs and redone. My parents, unbeknownst to me, decided to be helpful and try to ‚Äúseal‚Äù the garage before I moved in. 

The filled the expansion gap (north wall) with sand and caulked over it. They covered the rest of the perimeter with sand and caulked/quick concreted over it. Nothing set right, everything split open, and I guess due to the airflow between the garage and house or attic and house, my house smelled like caulk and a dust storm. Not only did the smell and gritty air drive me crazy, but I started developing severe health issues after moving in. 

I have since spent the past 6 months gradually scraping of caulk/concrete and digging sand out of the expansion gap using folders, mailers, whatever I could fit down there to scoop with. Much of the sand was wet, and since clearing that out, the humidity in my house has improved, and the smell has gotten better. 

The caulk/concrete has been impossible to completely get off, as they applied it directly to the bottom of the framing. The framing on the south wall sits at ground level, and as I started getting the caulk off, water came out onto the garage floor, so I think it had been getting trapped in/under the framing. 

My questions are:

1. Do I need to worry about the bottom of the framing rotting out due to moisture getting trapped under the remaining caulk? Since they put sand down before they caulked it, the friction from the slab moving actually caused some of the wood to splinter off too. 

2. How worried should I be about the expansion gap? I got much of the sand out, but couldn‚Äôt get it all due to the gap being narrow in places. Also, the sand was packing the gap for a couple years and I don‚Äôt know if that caused any damage. 

3. How worried do I need to be about mold having started growing behind the sheet rock due to the caulk seeming to have prevented drying for the couple + years  it was there? I don‚Äôt see any visible mold, but I started getting so sick after moving in here, which started as the first big snow we got after moving in began to melt. We‚Äôre talking dizziness to the point I can‚Äôt drive, red and burning skin, facial swelling, etc. 

4. Are there other things I should be doing/thinking about? 

Thanks for any thoughts you can provide. I‚Äôd just say screw it and wait to see if anything happened, if not for the health issues. I‚Äôm trying to take care of this on my own, but it‚Äôs definitely not my area of expertise.

Filthy floor protectors, am I being crazy? I hired a reputable plumbing firm to replace my water heater. I am having a very tough time coming to terms with them having put filthy drop cloths on my floor and carpet. I initially thought about providing my own floor protectors but since the company was so highly reviewed I figured that there's would be fine.

If the previous house they were at was infested with say bed bugs or termites, could that be transferred to my house? Did they really put never washed, toilet water residue drop cloths on my carpet?

Hello, I‚Äôm at a bit of a loss and was wondering if anyone had any advice.  I lost my dad suddenly a few years ago and I don‚Äôt have anyone else who knows about things like home renovations etcetera 

I have a 15 year old townhouse that I‚Äôve been living in for 8 years.  It has a tile entryway and tile in the bathrooms which are both on the top floor.  There are two tall sets of stars and two main floors.  The main floor on the first level is an engineered hardwood or laminate.  The stairs and top floor were carpeted however I ripped it out a few years ago because the previous owners had dogs and it was in poor shape.  I basically just painted the stairs/hardwood subfloor and we‚Äôve been living on that.  I‚Äôm hesitant to re-carpet because I have cats and I‚Äôm not a fan of how dirty carpet can become.  I realize that might be my cheapest option though.

I‚Äôm very handy but I‚Äôm sort of at a loss as to what I can/should install on the stairs/top floor.

If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it, also my DM‚Äôs are open.  Thank you!

Front Entry Door is....melting Hey guys, my wife and I have recently joined the first time homeowner club, and we're very excited to be able to own a home. However, we're pretty amateur when it comes to fixing stuff around the house. The internet And YouTube have been a big help so far in getting a few other home projects done. For this one, I felt like turning to Reddit for suggestions.

I live in the Midwest part of the US, and it has been HOT lately. Our front entry door gets the evening sun and just soaks it up. It's a darker color with a storm door in front of it. It gets so hot that it would probably give you a first degree burn if you touched it long enough (the metal parts at least). There's been some sticky adhesive type stuff leaking from the window part of the door. I assume it's to help hold part of the trim in place or something, but the heat is just scorching it. The paint under it is bubbling as well probably from the adhesive leaking down under it.

So, do you guys have any suggestions? My initial thoughts for fixing this are:

- paint the door a lighter color so it absorbs less rays (not ideal as it matches the exterior of the house well)
- scrape off all adhesive and paint around the edge of the window and use some outdoor heavy duty caulking to seal it and repaint
Dirt? Behind basement bathroom wall Found some water behind my finished bathroom basement wall (It's an old basement, they probably shouldn't have had drywall put in) and This was on some of The flooring tucked under the drywall. Anyone know what it is?
Tracing a water leak So it rained overnight and noticed that water leaked through a recessed can and left a water stain on the ground floor kitchen ceiling. 

Directly above the kitchen is a bathroom. No evidence of a leak there except the hallway carpet by the doorway is wet/damp. No one took a shower/bath in that bathroom yesterday.

Checked the crawlspace above the bathroom and don‚Äôt see any obvious evidence of leaks/water damage but I‚Äôll be honest its tight up there, difficult to maneuver and I‚Äôm working with a headlamp trying to look around. I‚Äôm also not super well versed in this area beyond ‚Äúis it wet?‚Äù

There is a masonry chimney very close to the area, but no obvious signs of water getting in around it that I can see. 

Any obvious tests, signs or other things I should be looking for? 

I‚Äôm doing more research, and calling around so I‚Äôm not only relying on reddit for advice but putting this here in case any savants happen read this and think of something obvious to tryüôÇ
Window was leaking from bottom of window after torrential downpour Just bought a condo and during the first torrential rain, there was some water leaking from that gap highlighted in the picture.

Perforated pipe for downspout extension? I just ran a 4" perforated corrugated pipe from my downspout to a pop up emitter about 25 feet away. The pipe is covered by a sock to filter out dirt. 

I'm no professional but I think I did a good job digging a trench that slopes down about 12" over 25 feet. 

I'm worried about two things: 
1. Is the perforated pipe just going to let all the water out into the earth on its way to the emitter?
2. Should I have laid gravel over top? I figured it wasn't really intended to be a french drain so that wouldn't matter too much.

Water under lvp flooring So my daughter took a long bath and afterwards I noticed that when I walked on the lvp flooring in the bathroom it made kind of a "squish" noise. Had I not heard this noise I would not have noticed because the bathroom was bone dry otherwise. So I believe I have a leak in either the tub drain or somehow from the drain selector knob that's built for overflow. 

When the lvp was installed I know there was a layer of underlayment or sheeting put down and I think that's the noise I'm hearing because it's wet. What is this best plan of attack to fix this before it becomes a problem to the flooring? The lvp is about 2 years old and supposedly waterproof but I'm certain it's not good for the floor to have that much water under it. 

I couldn't find much on YouTube other than a guy drilling holes into the lvp and using a big shop vac to suck the water out after a hurricane flood but that doesn't seem like the best fix imo.
White chalk-like substance (efflorescence) found and spreading in unused garage floor? Cause for concern and how to treat? [https://imgur.com/a/npyRwuT](https://imgur.com/a/npyRwuT)

Looking for some advice. Our garage floor has been developing a white chalk-like powdery substance that seems to "stick." I believe it may be efflorescence?

Some details:

* New construction SFH that was completed spring of 2022.
* It has been vacant and the garage has been unused since.
* No vehicle is housed there nor has it ever driven into garage. Only minor foot traffic every few days from opening the garage and walking in/out for entry.
* In addition, every 3 months, pest control company sprays their insecticide near the driveway portion and outer edges of the inside of the garage but this eventually dries up with ease. No residue is seen.
* There is a electric heat pump water heater in the garage.
* Slight gap between bottom of garage door weatherseal and slab. Seems like "a lot of stuff" can blow inwards from our driveway. After almost a year and a half, normal cracks/holes can be seen in the garage.
* We don't have this issue at our other properties. We're not sure if it's because the grading of this particular house, or if the builder forgot to put a vapor barrier, or something else.

My questions are as follows:

1. Is this a cause for concern or purely cosmetic?
2. What may be the source of this and where/how is the "vapor" migrating? The only thing I can think of is maybe the garage is getting some slight moisture issues from the electric heat pump water heater as it pushes out colder air since the garage tends to run cooler. I have also noticed a slight gap in the bottom of the garage door weatherseal so maybe there is a wind draft that is "pushing" the cold air inward at night. I initially noticed the white substance limited to 1-2 feet within the edge of the garage floor meets the driveway (where the roll up door would sit), however, I have observed recently, that the efflorescence has been creeping inward closer to the garage door entry. There shouldn't be any water leaks since the house has not been using any water but I guess the only active water source is my automated front lawn sprinklers or neighbors' drip lines which are 20+ ft away? I don't think it is a crawlspace issue underneath? Maybe poor drainage from the perimeter of the slab? My main concern is undetected moisture somewhere.
3. I asked the homebuilder but they suggested that the concrete is porous and unsealed so this is common. They advised to "pressure wash and apply a sealer to the concrete." Is this the best course of action? If so, I was going to get a garage professional to do it. I wouldn't want epoxy but some sort of sealer would be okay, especially if it helps prevent further cracking.
4. If I'm going with a professional, should I ask them to perform a moisture vapor transmission / calcium chloride test?
5. Otherwise, if I were to try to wash it off myself, how should I go about cleaning this so it doesn't come back? If efflorescence is caused by vapor, would I have to figure out how to best seal the garage so no wind/moisture leaks can enter? Any cleaning agents that you would recommend?
Suggestions for deadbolts that don't get rekt by a crowbar Hello all,

I had my house broken into by a person with an 8' round fence post that they put between my door and my doorjamb and managed to pull the locking bolt out of the dead bolt. I had 4" wood screws holding the strike plate into the king stud, but they managed to pull the lock apart. Anyone know of locks that don't do this, or do this with more effort?

Tips to Keep Electricity Bill Down in a Two-Story House in SoCal I just recently started renting a two-story house in Southern California and am looking for tips on how to keep the electricity bill down during the summer - especially in regards to the A/C.

My bill for July is going to be around $400+ and I know it‚Äôs that high due to the AC. I‚Äôm trying to figure out the best way to keep the house cool enough during the heat wave without breaking the bank. What‚Äôs some tips you have for a two-story house? Do you keep the thermostat at a set temp for the whole day or do you just put the AC on at night?
Artillery fungus or flea marks? We‚Äôve had these spots rapidly appearing in our home. It‚Äôs definitely dog related because it only appears in spaces of our home that our dogs occupy. We‚Äôve had our pest control company check it out & no results. They grow like mold/fungus (one spot multiples) but lots of ppl say it resembles flea marks.

Took 4 times longer than expected and cost more than I originally thought, but upgrading the patio doors has been my favorite home improvement. The building is designated historic, so I had to include a ‚Äúfalse column‚Äù to keep it looking original from the outside.  Along the way discovered the previous flipper didn‚Äôt level the floor, the balcony was tilted inwards to the point that we debated pouring concrete, and the glass was plate glass from the 60s that had never been updated (and totally wasn‚Äôt to code).  Can‚Äôt wait to entertain!
Sealing my crawlspace Hello!

We bought our first house and the crawlspace has some cracks in the concrete, some space with no concrete blocks (and just plywood blocking it off), and some space where the yard doesn't come up to the bottom of these boards. 

We've been given the advice of getting a landscaper to fill in those low gaps, and to work on grading so water flows away from the house. What else should be done here? (Super super new. Eli5 please)

How hard to disconnect this ourselves? We have contractors coming on Monday to install new counters and a new single-drain sink. At first we were told they could do the plumbing part too but today they said we need to have a plumber in before to disconnect everything and then again 24 hrs after to rework the pipes. Our plumber isn't available before Monday. Trying to decide if we could do this ourselves or need to start calling around to randos/ thinking about postponing the install. We have zero experience other than using the shutoff valves. What do you think, could we handle disconnection?

How to keep home smelling good consistently Every time I look this question up, the suggestions come back to ‚Äúclean your house‚Äù

The house is clean. It‚Äôs not the rugs, or the trash, or the sink. Nothing stinks, it doesn‚Äôt smell particularly nice in general- at least not long term.

I‚Äôve been using glade plug-ins for ever but replacing them often is costly, especially with so many rooms, and the scent is barely noticeable after the first few days unlss I‚Äôm right next to it 

I have a fear of house fires, so candle use is not ideal.

I came across reed diffusers as an option, I wanted to see if anyone had good experience with them before I potentially waste $30

Should Basement French Drain Have Water In It? **TL;DR, Went down to the basement to find that our home's French drain is almost full of water. My mother doesn't recall there ever being water in the drain in the 20+ years that my family has owned the home (we're the original homeowners). Is this normal?**



So my mother and I went down to the basement to dry up some water that had leaked from the garden hose, and instead of soaking all the water up with paper towels, I began to push the water into the hole of our basement's French drain system. We were both surprised to hear the splashing sound when the water from the floor met the standing water in the drain. I shone my flashlight in the pit and saw the standing water, two black corrugated pipes, and a white PVC pipe. 

What concerned us was that the black corrugated pipes seemed to be split as if they were once supposed to be together at one point. (If this is normal, why would they sit like that?) Absolutely no clue what the white pipe is below the black pipes (maybe someone can help me better understand). My mom says that we don't have a sump pump, and I can confirm that no cords are coming out of the pit, only the single white pipe that goes up between the walls after it splits into two different runs of pipe. 

I took a look in the second pit, which doesn't have any pipes in it or going into it (not sure if it's even connected with the French drain, but the two pits are right next to each other (the only difference I can discern is that the French drain is a large diameter corrugated pit and has a white PVC pipe coming down from the wall and running on the floor until it reaches the pit which has an oblong opening flush with the basement floor whereas the other pit, which doesn't appear to be corrugated and has no pipes running into it (not sure what the little bit of water at the bottom is from. Could very well be from the cleanup of the hose water but I'm not 100% sure on that) instead, this pit doesn't have an oblong opening flush with the floor it has two round holes about two or three inches in diameter which have a lip to them. 

I took pictures, and we plan to call a professional when we return from vacation in two weeks. Can someone please help me understand if this is something we should worry more about? Feel free to ask any follow-up questions, and I'll do my best to answer them! 

Thanks!!!

Filling driveway cracks Hey there,
We recently bought our first house!
Our driveway has some significant cracking due to previous drainage issues (which have since been fixed). I know ultimately it needs replaced, but for now I‚Äôd like to prevent further damage. What is the proper way to seal/fill the cracks? Polymeric sand, self leveling sealant, concrete sealer?

Cost of Modular vs Stick-Built? Florida Polk/Osceola County. I have been trying to do research on these topics for days now and it's incredibly difficult to find quotes or prices on either of these builds. Finding a contractor that will quote a single home build is astonishingly complicated and finding a modular home provider that provides MODULAR homes and not MANUFACTURED homes is even worse. Does anyone have any info on what one can expect to pay, not including land, per SQ/ft on a modular home (factory built framing, assembled on site to a permanent foundation) or stick built home? Any info on what delivery costs look like for modular homes as well?
CA - Insulation Home Requirements I am not seeking legal advice, but some insight from those more well-versed in the codes and regulations for houses in California.

Crack in ceiling. What's my next step?  Bought a townhome about a year and a half ago and had to remove textured ceiling throughout the unit because they painted it with regular paint and the texture cracked and fell. I have no confidence they painted this ceiling with bathroom paint.

Thank you in advance

Milgard Trinsic vs Marvin Essentials slider windows? We are adding several 5‚Äôx5‚Äô slider windows to our dining room and have narrowed down our options to either Marvin Essentials (fiberglass) or Milgard Trinsic (vinyl).

Electric baseboard heating- Honeywell aube Th106 thermostat not working, need a better replacement/ smart thermostat if possible 

Hi. I have Aube TH106 Electric Heating 7-Day Programmable Thermostat that is malfunctioning. The heat was continuously on during the hot summer and setting/resetting it didn‚Äôt work. I finally turned off the breaker to stop it. This is for electric baseboard heating in my bedroom. I already spoke to Mysa thermostat company and they said their thermostat doesn‚Äôt support the thermostat with 2 wires only. Can I get better thermostat recommendations that is easy to program? Also any possible recommendations on smart thermostats that works with this?

What‚Äôs the Best Way to Connect Range Hood to Exhaust Vent Near Floor? My place had an existing perforation and exhaust vent to the outside, but there was no ducting connected to it. Now I want to connect a range hood, but it looks like the easiest way to do it would result in the ducting being exposed between the countertop and cabinet. 

Any other ideas on how to approach this? Is there a reason why the perforation would be near the floor and not higher?

Goodman Central AC. Hi All, Relative new homeowner here with a newbie question. 
My AC stopped working. ( I have another zone which is working).

Please help if there's anything basic I need to check/be aware of before calling in some professionals.

Removing old paint drops on wood floor Looking to get rid of these paint stains on our floor. They are pretty much everywhere in my apartment. The last woman who lived here didn‚Äôt put down any tarp when painting and left it for the next person. Is there any options other than scraping them off and damaging the floor?
Dishwasher started flooding under my sink last night and I found the drain hose not connected to anything. How should I approach this? Came back from a walk & noticed water flowing out from under my sink area. Turned off the power and cleared out the cabinet & noticed the hose (1st pic) loose under the sink. I found where it should go and slid it back in to the pipe, but it doesn't seem like this set up is 100% right.

Also, when trying to unplug the dishwasher from the extension cord it was plugged into (after I turned the power off to that outlet), the plug wouldn't come out of the extension cord. I pried it out with a screwdriver & the prongs stayed in the extension cord.

The entire platform and sides of the cabinet under the sink are soft and wet. Also, the baseboard under the cabinet has water damage as well.

What steps should I take to fix this? I was thinking:

1. Contact the dishwasher manufacturer to get a new cord & have that installed.

2. Contact a plumber to make sure all the connections in the dishwasher are appropriately installed.

3. Contact a contractor to replace the cabinetry under the sink as well as the baseboard.

Any thoughts or suggestions?
Concerns over insulating a room that was previously garage I moved into a cute (small) 1950s home a few years back. The one car garage had been converted into living space at some point prior and it's now my art studio. It's on the opposite side of the house from the thermostat, and I feel the temp fluctuations in there the most. I've also come to find out the sheetrock is extremely thin! I'm having a mini-split quoted to add to that room, but was thinking it might also be beneficial to rip out the drywall, and put insulation and standard-thickness drywall in before putting in the mini-split. I've read so many different things on whether or not to add insulation to older homes... because they weren't made for it and it will just trap moisture in the walls. The exterior of my home has hardboard siding and I live in West Texas, if that matters..... Was hoping someone with some experience with older homes could give me their thoughts. 
Floor concerns For about a year now, the damage on the left side of our floor has been growing (it used to look like the right horizontal wood).

Does anyone have an idea of what might be going on?

Terminex is Awful I have recently gotten terminex and I am so displeased with their services. I have a termite problem and obviously wanted to take care of it as soon as possible. I‚Äôve had Orkin before but Terminex seemed to offer more protection. Due to the termites I have seen some minimal damage to my house. The technician comes does what he is supposed to do and leaves. I still see termite activity and the damage has gotten worse. I may not know much but I would like to think that if a professional comes to your home to fix a problem then the problem will be fixed when they leave. I try to contact the terminex technician; radio silence. I called to make another appointment, they day of they‚Äôre a no show. Despite me calling in twice to verify the appointment. Make another appointment they don‚Äôt come again. They are an incredibly expensive, non-effective company and I am sickened that I have to be in a contract with them for the next year. I read their reviews on the BBB website: horrible! Everyone has a similar story.
I have dust mites So per my post history, I have been having really bad itching issues. My dad suggested that I probably have some sort of microscopic mites. I recently cleaned my mattress with vinegar and baking soda and got an anti-mite mattress casing to be on the safe side, although I had my doubts that mites were the cause of my problems.

Surprise surprise! I just spotted two visible sized mites crawling on my sheets beside me while lying down! Convinced that dust mites are the issue after all. Good to know I found the cause of my itching but I‚Äôm only 19 and clueless, no idea how to permanently get rid of them. For the record, I got the anti-mite mattress casing about two weeks ago, and I also washed my bed sheets and duvet before putting them over the improved mattress. So I‚Äôm guessing that mites aren‚Äôt completely killed from being thrown in a wash and dry cycle. Am I going to have to buy new bed sheets and duvet and throw out my old ones? If so will the mites be gone for good? Or is it possible they could come from another source? I have pet birds, but after changing my sheets I moved the cage away from my bed and on the other side of my room to be safe‚Äî plus they don‚Äôt act itchy or like they have any skin irritation. I will admit I have a bit of a messy room, but it‚Äôs not like I leave food out or anything I can imagine that would attract bugs. I want to be clean and make sure I get rid of my itching problem for good. I want these little shits GONE! What can I do?

Roof vent leaks - likely installed poorly. About two years ago, I had a family member install a new roof for only the cost of materials. It was the best option at the time, given costs. However, both of the bathroom vents leak. And one of the vent pipes broke off in a storm. Scared of heights, I braved the ladder up and this is what I see. Obviously it looks off. Best course of action to replace this? Is it something a non pro could do? Should I just recaulk and replace the part? 
Thanks  in advance! I'm more used to indoor self repairs, not out. 

For reference, he used and insisted on a silicon caulk. Instead of the rubber tube pipes, he used metal chimney pipes that were L shaped. The other vent is intact, but also leaks.

Knocked a piece of drywall out to fix a hole, and this was on the backside‚Ä¶should I be worried? For context, it‚Äôs an old house built in the 1930s.

In the future I might be moving to a new house. Can anyone suggest a good hammock? So I don't know for sure. But in the future my mother might be getting a new place, and instead of a bed, I wanna get a hammock. But I don't know of any good, affordable hammocks. There's a ton on Amazon...buuut I don't really trust Amazon that much. So can anyone suggest a strong, affordable, and possibly easy to set up hammock for indoor spaces? It can either be a hammock you string up on a wall, or a hammock that's on a stand. I don't mind either option to be honest.
Recommended mid-priced cutting tool for large IKEA panels I‚Äôm inquiring about the best mid-priced cutting tool for large IKEA panels and filler pieces (for a large IKEA Enkoping pantry).

I don‚Äôt have a ton of room for storage of it when not in use, but I know buying one would be cheaper than hiring someone (especially around here).  

I don‚Äôt have large work tables so advise if I need saw horses or a particular type of table setup.

Thanks

Recs for refinishing metal patio furniture? I inherited a metal patio dining set that has seen a lot of sun, and now shows a lot of wear / oil stains after meals that requires scrubbing for cleanup. Any recommendations for restoring the painted finish, or alternatively, for repainting it? The coating hasn‚Äôt started flaming off - it just has lost its protective outer coating and now seems to be a little porous.

What is this strange crack/peeling on the ceiling without a drywall? 7-year-old two-story house. This is the bedroom ceiling on the first (bottom) floor. The top of this is a second-floor bedroom, not the roof:

[https://imgur.com/a/wheledp](https://imgur.com/a/wheledp)

We bought the house about a year ago. Nothing on the disclosures. I discovered this crack/peeling today, but it could have happened 0-4 months ago because I don't use this room much.

I do not know when the ceiling was last painted.

The crack/peeling does not extend to any wall.

What's really confusing to me is: the peeling stuff looks like paint, and the yellow thing looks like a wood plank. So where is my ceiling drywall? I thought usually you hang a drywall so there should be drywall between the wood and the paint.

What do you think the cause is? Structural issues of ceiling sagging? Leaking water (didn't see any sign of it although it may have dried between occurrence and now)? No biggie because it's just paint peeling and some joint compound, sanding and repainting will fix it?

What kind of professionals should I look for? Plumber? Structural engineer? 

Thank you very much for you help!
How to finish tub/surround? Home is 60yrs old. New tub and surround barely fit into existing alcove. The surround flange comes out to the finished edge of the drywall on one side, the other side it is very close the window. Just wondering the best way to finish this.

Can I use drywall on the flange where the wall is perpendicular, then use reinforced drywall corner and finish it as a normal wall? Would it be better to just slap another layer of drywall on the perpendicular wall so that the flange isn't so close to the edge? If I do this the finished wall will be insanely close to the door trim.

The other wall, if I put a regular depth sheet of drywall on the surround flange it won't be flush with the existing drywall by the toilet, it will be nearly 1/4 inch farther out and would prob require the whole wall be redrywalled + window trim be removed and reinstalled.

Also not sure how to finish against the edges of the tub, either with the walls or the floor. There is 1 inch gap between flooring and tub apron.

Thank you
What insect would cause this? Just found this on our wood deck this morning. There is a hole above it where I assume all of it fell out of. I believe the deck rails are made of cedar. We‚Äôve had a few carpenter ants around but had them treated about 4 weeks ago. Any idea what might have done this?
Technician says he can‚Äôt clean my interior AC evaporator coils without charging me $500, is this true? Hey folks, my AC is giving off a musty smell. I had a technician out today to check the system and he said the smell is most likely coming from the evaporator coils inside the unit shown in the picture, but claims that in order for him to clean it he would have to charge $500 to ‚Äútear into custom plenum‚Äù and perform the service, possibly involving some metal fabrication to re-seal. 

I did some research about cleaning coils on older units after he left, and I found a set of instructions stating to remove the access panel by removing the metal tape which seals the panel. Is that not what I have going on here (see pic)? Why would he have to ‚Äútear into the custom plenum‚Äù and why would he have to custom fabricate anything to re-seal when it looks like they would just put it back together with new tape?
How to clean refinished tub? My dad and I refinished the tub in my apt recently, it seems like some dust got stuck to it while it was drying (not much but enough to make it feel sort of uneven under my feet).

Best Way to Mount new doorbell Replacing old doorbell with a new ring doorbell camera. Want to keep it at the same spot due to wiring. 

The surface is slightly uneven along the right side. What would be the best method to even it out? The ring doorbell camera is larger than the original doorbell so it won‚Äôt fit in the same slot. If I mount it as is then the wires would be exposed. Using a wedge angled mount. 

Option 1 - cutting out some of the wood on the right side to make it even. what would be the best tool for that? 

Option 2 - adding a thin layer of ply wood to make it even in the area. Would there be a better material for this?
Anyone know how to fix this? Sorry for the pics, it's really hard to see in the camera but the wood in my table has bubbled up in an area. Any idea on a solution?
Mold underneath deck? Is this mold growing on the underside of my deck? If so, what should I do about it?
I've got mold I've got discoloration of the baseboard next to my shower which had me concerned about water getting through the gap by the shower door.

Further investigation had me move a dresser in the corner of the bedroom on the other side of the shared wall and this is what I found.

Any tips on where to go from here? Any idea on how big the problem might be? I know we'll need to cut out some drywall and replace.

Sealing concrete drive to stone foundation? We're staying with the in-laws in Pittsburgh who recently (2 years ago?) had their driveway redone. MIL just asked me this morning about a gap where the drive meets the stone foundation where she's concerned about water and bugs possibly entering. 

I assume there's some sort of elastic exterior caulking or sealant they could get to seal it up but I had no specific recommendation. 

Anyone have tips or a specific product that would work well here? Many thanks.

Hanging with metal studs? My wife bought a yoga trapeze that hangs from the ceiling. We were doing so stud finding in the basement and discovered that our studs are metal (through the stud finder). I know we need to use a cobalt drill bit to drill into it, but how can we know how much weight the studs can support? I believe these are structural to hold up the floor above, but don't want to do anything that may compromise the structural integrity of the ceiling due to the weight it will be holding.

How much discrepancy do you typically see between contractors estimates for a job? We‚Äôre currently in the midst of getting some estimates from contractors to rebuild our deck and add a screened in porch onto part of it. I‚Äôve gotten 3 quotes from 3 different contractors so far and I‚Äôm really confused by how much they differ.

The first guy quoted us $13,000 but also told us when he was at the house that his ‚Äúdaily rate‚Äù was $450 which seemed‚Ä¶off (I‚Äôve never heard of a contract charging a daily rate and that seems like it would incentivize a long drawn-out job).

Second guy came out and quoted us $80,000 and I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh in his face.

Third guy quoted us $44,000 but that price is with us doing all the demo/debris removal.

After getting these 3 quotes I‚Äôm wondering how there could be a $67,000 discrepancy between the quotes. Is that normal? 

I know costs vary a lot based on your location but if anyone is in the vicinity of Charlotte, NC and is a contractor or knows the industry better than I do and could guesstimate how much they think a job like this would cost, I‚Äôd sure appreciate any insight you could give me.

The deck is 14‚Äôx50‚Äô with one staircase with a 5‚Äôx5‚Äô landing. The screened in porch would be 14‚Äôx20‚Äô with a gabled roof extending to just below the second floor windows. We‚Äôd be using treated lumber for the boards and joists.
Thanks!
How do I fix this hinge? I can't find an exact replacement online (these have oval holes on one side to make adjustment easier). They go on the plantation shutters in the background. What's the best way to go about fixing the hinge (red arrow) without messing up irreparably? Thanks!
Mushrooms growing after basement flooded Denver, CO area here. A couple of weeks ago, the crawlspace under my basement floor flooded when the sump pump failed. I replaced the sump pump and it drained the space no problem.

How concerned should I be? Are there home remedies or do I need to hire professionals? The cat‚Äôs litter box is near this, but other than that we aren‚Äôt in the basement too often. I truly appreciate any advice. Thanks!
Question about permitting Ok so. My wife and I bought a 1916 craftsman and completed a studs up renovation. I fully admit we did not file for the permits required. Later I filed for a permit to move the main service from one side of the house to the other. Permit was issued and the work was completed. After the inspection I was told that I was under permit enforcement because there appeared to be work completed without a permit. I was honest and admitted to work done without a permit and filed the permits retroactively per their direction. I got a bunch of the permits signed off and closed, however the plumbing inspector is refusing to sign of unless I expose every pipe in the house including cutting open the slab (no I did not do any plumbing under the slab, though I understand I am responsible for all work completed weather by me or not). I tried to reason with him and offered to have it scoped ect but he is unwilling to proceed. 

My question is: Do I have to close the permit?! What can happen if I don't? I understand I will have to disclose unpermitted work when selling and that COULD affect the sale price...is there anything else? My main concern is that I want to build an attached garage, with permits of course, I learned my lesson....can they hold my garage project/permit hostage because I don't close my plumbing permit?

TLDR: Can not closing a permit lead to you not being able to get and close other permits in the future?

Is this an acceptable gap/design? I am in the midst of renovating my half bath.  I wanted to keep the 28‚Äù vanity since it is good quality wood.  I got a 30.5‚Äùwhite countertop (see pictures) that will have a bit of overhang.  I didn‚Äôt want a larger vanity since it‚Äôs be tight with the toilet.  The previous countertop spanned the whole wall length and the vanity was flush against the wall.  I‚Äôd like to have the new countertop flush like in the pictures, but have the vanity pulled a bit away for symmetry which produces a gap around 1.25‚Äù to the wall. Does it look okay?  I don‚Äôt want to pull them away from the wall because the toilet would be so close and I‚Äôd feel cramped sitting there.

French drain in basement For some reason the last owner put spray foam in the French drain channel and all around the cover to the sump pump‚Ä¶ so I have no idea how they thought it would actually drain water.

I have removed most of the spray foam in the channel, but I am not sure what to do once I pull up the ‚Äòcover‚Äô. Just create a new cover which allows water in, or other ideas?

I was also planning on leaving the channel open, but maybe it should have a grate of some sort? The basement does not really get moisture in it, so I am ok with just leaving it for now. Maybe a bug attractor though.

former hoarder house smell issue not sure if anyone will have possible solutions but here‚Äôs the situation. november 2022 i moved into a house that until october 2022 was being lived in by a couple who were major hoarders. we‚Äôre talking trash to your knees in the entire house, unbelievable rat infestation, smokers who smoked in the house, etc. they lived here for about 20 years before my dad (the landlord and now my landlord) evicted them. for the entire month of october my dad recovered the entire house, ripped up all the floors replaced the any drywall with mold, replaced all appliances etc. since this we have still had issues with a lingering smell. all the walls have been painted with KILZ and we have recently used an Ozone machine and let it run in the house for a good 36 hours and still there is a dusty old smell. previously it was more of a sour smell but the ozone machine did help a little bit now it‚Äôs more mild but still not inviting. any advice as to how to get my house to not smell like this anymore?!

replacing lock cylinders all around the house I have 3 doors with 3 different keys. I would like to replace them all so that they have the same key, however with them being different brands and different types and colors I am not sure if I can do that. One is a bronze finish front door and the other 2 are normal utility doors with deadbolts. I found a kwikset 2 door hardware kit that I can use on the side doors but the front door has a bronze handle on it that wouldn't match the silver locks on the other doors. Can I possibly have the front cylinder re-keyed to match the other 2? Is there a kit that I can do that with or do I need a locksmith?

How Do I Replicate This Paint Texture? I am renovating our home's exterior wall and had to cut out a large section of it.

The old wood that I removed from the wall looks to be some type of MDF board. It appears there is no texturing behind the paint, or stucco, etc. It appears to just be a few layers of paint. See [imgur pictures here](https://imgur.com/a/e6SoolZ)

How would I go about replicating this texture using only paint on wood? Or would I need to apply a texture (kind of like a drywall texture) and then paint? This is for a wall that is outside the home so if I need to use texturing it needs to be water/weatherproof
Roof Replacement Question Hello, I had my concrete tile roof replaced, however, the roofer did not replace the flashing.  When I inquired, I was told they will install walk-a-flex flashing when they return to lay the tiles in September, and they cannot replace the metal flashing, as it would require a teardown of the new underlayment. 
 My concern is that I've had several leaks, with the most recent, due to bad/damaged flashing.  
Is walk-a-flex flashing as good as metal flashing and is it now being used in place of metal flashing?  
Your responses are appreciated.  Thank you.
Any advice on fixing this? I just bought this house and the old owners appeared to be really into DIY-ing. Well they did a terrible job on this shower.

Or perhaps any contractors can give be a quote on what this might cost to have a professional fix it?

Large tree branches fell on roof, not damage visible from inside/attic, do I call roofer or tree removal first? Have a tree next to our house that lost most of its branches in a recent storm and a good portion of them fell and rolled/slid down our roof while a few are still on the roof (will probably need to get the tree removed as it‚Äôs likely dying if so many of the branches fell). 

My brain says roofer first, for them to assess damage and take pictures in the event an insurance claim is needed. 

Then to call tree removal service to take care of the dying tree and remove the branches and debris from the roof.

Wanted second opinion as I am a first time home owner and just want a confidence check on this.

Thanks in advance!
I need help Mini Split replacement issues I had a LG MiniSplit installed 5 years ago over the wood siding the house came with. Two years ago I had the siding replaced with vinyl. Two months ago my MiniSplit started making awful noise like clicking when it‚Äôs on in whatever mode. Spoke to two different local installers as the original installer is now out of business. Only one has the time to send a guy out, at the time I thought it needed to be cleaned and serviced. Found out the LG has a recall and is under warranty. Its damn hot and I was already considering getting a second unit installed on the other side of the house so agreed to have both jobs done after much back and forth about the availability of replacement units and the timing of install (I have a vacation planned in August.) Set a date, new unit install, warranty unit replaced same day. 

Today is the day. Guys show up, are sub contractors for this company. Install secondary unit upstairs, all good, quick, efficient, and knowledgeable. Suddenly work stops, figure they‚Äôre taking a break but decide to go check out what‚Äôs going on. Come to find they can‚Äôt take out the old unit as the siding guy worked over top of the lines they need access to. The original technician that came out to ‚Äúservice‚Äù the LG unit was supposed to take pictures, and assess the site for replacing the unit. He didn‚Äôt want rather ‚Äúneed‚Äù to go out side to see the unit and assured me it would be a easy install. So these guys called the office and we‚Äôre told not to touch my siding, to pack up and leave. The company office won‚Äôt answer their phone and I have no way of contacting them otherwise. 

Here‚Äôs where I need help. I don‚Äôt know what to do from here, I‚Äôm damn angry, just spent thousands of dollars and didn‚Äôt even get the original job I requested done. If the first service guy had done his job I would have been able to call the guys that did my siding to get it ready for today. Now I‚Äôm stuck with a broken unit in my living room and no idea what I should be demanding from this company. Their service guy messed up, by not taking all the information they need. I hate to add qualifiers to this but I‚Äôve experienced it over and over again, I am a single woman with only the support of my adult daughter, I feel I‚Äôve been taken advantage of. I don‚Äôt want to pay a bill to have my siding pulled off or fixed or whatever needs to happen, I just want to be able to sit in my living room without melting in the summer heat. 

I guess I just need advice. The pictures are of the old unit, the siding, and the covers. If anyone knows about this stuff can give me an idea of what to expect, or how they think I can move forward I‚Äôd really appreciate it.

My home feels like a cheap apartment, where and how do I start? Hi everyone, I'm looking on some advice on how to make my home feels less like a cheap "landlord special" apartment and more like a well put together home. We plan on living in this house another 5 to 10 years at the most.

My fiance and I bought our small 1080 sq ft 120+ year old home last june, and I have noticed a lot of little things that kind of make me unhappy about it. From the pictures, the trim/baseboards all around the house are poorly maintained with what seems like multiple layers of pain over them. The outlets and light switches are popping off the wall or crooked and not flush with the wall. The door frames are uneven, chipping, and generally ugly and not fitted well. All the window trims are again painted over very poorly with multiple and large chips missing, and clearly very old wood. The cabinets are also very old (based on old pictures found online they look to be from the 70s or 80s that were originally a pastel pink and we can tell they they same cabinets, just painted), and the pain is already starting to wear off, even on the old handles. The first floor is LVP, which to me feels a bit cheap, but pieces are separated and unevenz and there are large gaps between each piece which are very noticeable and gets dirt and debris stuck in them frequently. In front of the white painted fireplace is a ugly stone hearth with silicone trim around the edge, which is sloppy. The walls have a lot of uneven, grainy like textures randomly through the house and one wall has a horribly ugly slap brush type texture. Not to mention most walls are very crumbly plaster and not drywall so hanging stuff is near impossible. The window in the bathroom is clearly crooked with cracks around the frame. Paint around the cabinets is cracking and peeling on the walls. The last picture is a bit hard to tell what it is, but it is the outside deck that is now nice trex board, but they did not tear out the old rotting wood deck underneath, they just laid the new boards overtop. There are more problems that are hard to take pictures of like very uneven and sinking floors upstairs, a few ungrounded knob and tube wired outlets (which out dumb fuck inspector missed) and draining issues outside in the driveway and a crumbling fieldstone damp basement. The layout of the house also makes it feel much smaller and moving around some places you have to side step to get through. For now the small feeling is fine, but we plan on having a couple children in the next 1-3 years, and realisticly having more than one child in this house would be too hard.

Overall, I feel pretty upset with this house, but I wouldn't go as far as saying i regret buying the house altogether. Just wished we would have paid closer attention to some of the finer details. We were just so excited to find a house for very cheap, but unfortunately it also feels very cheap. What are some worthwhile things I can do to make this house feel more like a home and less like an apartment?
Asking painters for proof of liability insurance. I agreed to have my house painted by a company and signed their quote. When asked for their insurance info they they told me it was in underwriting and I should get it tomorrow. But they are suppose to pick up my deposit for the job today. I've had painters that has give me their insurance info when they did the estimate. Does this seem correct? I know they are doing another job this week somewhere else, why can't they provide me a copy on the spot? It's not too late for me to back out of the job if this seems fishy.
Chimney Estimate Question Ive got a block chimney that has developed cracking in the top 8-10 blocks. I live in a rural part of the North Eastern US, LCOL area. 

Ive had a chimney sweep and a local GC come out to give me repair estimates. 

**The GC:**


Wants to rebuild the whole chimney, pour a new foundation for the chimney. Gave me an estimate of $3,000. He seems to think the issue is caused by the base of the chimney settling because you can trace the cracks all the way to the bottom on the chimney, very faintly. He thinks this would be about a 2 day job. 

**The Chimney Sweep**

Wants to re-line the chimney and then replace the cracked blocks with class A chimney pipe. Quoted me just under $5,000. He thinks the chimney's foundation is fine, water intrusion between the liner and block is the problem. Personally, I think this makes the most sense. 


**My question:**

The GC's plan seems like it would be more work and material, but is somehow $2,000 less than the other plan. I get that the chimney sweep is an expert in Chimneys, so Im paying for their expertise, but something about the economics of estimate being less than half the materials, but still costing 40% more seems odd to me. 

Should I maybe get a third estimate just to compare? What would you do?
Toilet frequently clogs and needs to be plunged Toilet in my house frequently clogs and needs to be plunged.  Much more often than the other 2 and sometimes for a small of poop and toilet paper.

I'm hearing it's a little more complicated to snake out a toilet bc of the tight S bend and it's more fragile.

Struck by Lightning I am almost positive our home was struck by lightning during a storm last night. It was the closest, loudest boom I have ever heard and if it didn‚Äôt hit the house, it was definitely extremely close. 

Anyways I‚Äôm the morning, I went to find all of the outlets in garage not working and this one specifically was fried. This outlet had out invisible dog fence moderator and hot water heater plugged into - thankfully no fire. 

I tried resetting the breakers and GFCIs in the garage, but nothing worked. I‚Äôm just a little confused bc the outlets in the garage are not working but the electric garage door opener still works and everything else in the house still works. Mostly hoping the hot water heater unit isn‚Äôt messed up. 

Filed a claim already, but is there anything I can do in the 3 months it will take them to get back to me?
Vinyl Siding Nails Hello. I had vinyl siding installed on my home to replace old wooden siding. Shortly after install, one of the pieces fell off. They return and repaired it.

We made an appointment and on the appointment confirmation call they asked me about my credit. All I said was I was in the excellent category before I really thought about it. But I thought about it afterwards and the more I thought the more I took offense to them asking. Am I being too sensitive? They haven‚Äôt even been here yet and we haven‚Äôt talked about anything other than me wanting an estimate. 

Is asking about credit before the estimate the norm in the industry? I‚Äôm an original owner of new construction way back from 2002. So you know I am needing quite a bit of work done in the coming years.  I‚Äôd like to know if this is what I can expect going forward.  

I did cancel the appointment. It just felt weird.

Second floor small outdoor patio not draining causing rotting wood. Where do I even start? 
Odd funky smell I noticed this odd smell, I really can't describe it. Like very odd, not gasy at all more like almost a funky feet/sock smell is the best I can describe, like sour cheese but not, if that makes sense, but funky nontheless. At first I thought it was outside because the smell is right next to my window but when I put my nose and smell all around it I don't smell a thing other than the dust form the screen. thing is I've smelt this smell before out in the public. It's been well over 100¬∞ idk if that has to do with it. As I'm writing this the last time I smelt it was like 30 mins ago, it would come out of no where and last a few seconds. I hope it all makes sense reading it, the smeel is just so weird.
What could this be but more importantly how do u fix it?? Hello good folks of Reddit. I wanted to get some opinions on this issue I am having as a first time home buyer here in Southern California. So in the process of the final walk through of the house and we noticed that there is a crack on one of the back bed rooms we seen when first started has got worse. You can see them in the two pictures posted. For reference the first one was taken June 11 the second one was taken today. So it‚Äôs been about 6 weeks that the crack has changed quiet noticeably. More so not only that but it has now shown cracks within the closet next to it and spreading slightly to the other room as well. Some more quick notes we also had a certified structural engineer come out and look at everything. So the it‚Äôs not foundational which is good. Accord to him it could be due to possible sediment movement from water possibly getting underneath the house and/or wind and normal west and tear however he did state that it is unusual that it‚Äôs increased so much in such a short period of time. But more than likely it is because of those two factors. The room that the cracks are in to where the closet is located are not barring walls if that helps. Knock down the closet and still not need support. The contractors are supposed to come out again and redo it apparently. But seems like they didn‚Äôt do to good of a job the first time. But now my fianc√© is worried that if it is sediment movement due to water getting underneath the house that there could be mold under that possible? 



If there is any more details I can provide I‚Äôll try my best. But if the engineer said it‚Äôs nothing to worry about how would we fix it and it change even more in the next few months?

Can't get anything to stay in drywall I am trying to hang a curtain rod over my living room inset window. For the life of me I cannot get anything to grip well and stay in the drywall around the window. I've tried as straight anchors, screw anchors, and metal anchor screws. Every time I set them and go to hang the rod the anchors and screws come right out as the drywall just crumbles around it. I know my pilot holes aren't too big, as I've had to hammer or screw the anchors in place. I've even tried metal anchor screws with no pilot holes and those came right back out too. Anyone have a suggestion on what I can use? For context the house was built in 78. Idk if the drywall is just super old or they used cheap stuff to begin with, or both.

French Drain Pop-Up Emitter: Not working Installing my own french drain and water is exiting the perforated pipe before being forced out of the emitter. The pipe slopes downward until I begin to raise it at the end where the discharge is supposed to go, but it's exiting out of the slots rather than the emitter. What can I do to fix this? The trench is 18 inches deep for the whole run, and seems to work until it hits the last 4-5 feet of pipe where it's filling up in the trench. Would adding a 4-5 foot solid pipe fix the issue? I was blasting a garden hose right into my catch basin near the top under my gutter.

100 year old subfloor? My house was built around 1923 and later had a Michigan ledge basement added. I want to rip up the current carpet and refinish the wood floors but, I think I would need a subfloor to keep the unfinished basement smells, humidity, and radon gases from entering the main level. Does this look like there is a subfloor? Is this wood the subfloor?

What is on my baseboards/wall? Was cleaning the baseboards today, and I got to a section by the stairs. Moved a table out of the way to find this sticky substance stretching about 5 feet down the top of the baseboards and about 3 or 4 inches up the wall. Its sticky, but peels off like rubber. Problem is it's taking the paint with it.

I had originally thought it was just caulking until I noticed it on the walls, and also the fact that it was sticky even under the top coat of paint.

Does anyone have any idea what this is and how to get rid of it?

Just gutted my basement. Need some advice (Ontario, Canada) Hello everyone. 

Bought my first home 2 years ago and learning home improvement slowly but surely. 

I just gutted my basement as they'd used wood paneling and the ceiling was a drop ceiling. I wanted to dry wall everything, rewire everything to copper, change the floor and add pot lights. 

I found exterior walls to be a bit small. They're not 2x4s or 2x3s, they're more like 1 and 3/4 x 1 and a half or some thing like that. 

I really don't want to reframe everything. Is this okay? It's a pretty small basement.. Probably 20x25 FT. 

Thanks

Possessed Ceiling Fan: No Longer Responds To Remote; Turns On Randomly I've got a MinkaAire fan in my family room that just recently stopped responding to its remote control. It's hard wired and always hot, which isn't ideal, but it's been like this since I moved in. One day it just stopped responding to the remote control. I replaced batteries, checked the dip switches, etc. Everything looked fine.

A few months go by, and it just decides to turn itself on randomly. Since it was going in the wrong direction, I hit the FOR/REV button on my remote, and it stopped. I try and turn it back on low/med/hi and tried the light button on the remote and nothing. No response.

Same thing happened again the other day - fan randomly turns on, and any button I press on the remote just shuts it off. If I try and turn it back on, nothing happens.

Now, I have a fan on the opposite side of the house that rarely gets used (on the same frequency) and have even tried that remote, but still, no response.

What on earth is going on with this fan?

Active Wood-boring beetle infestation in bamboo floors Hi everyone,

About two months ago we found a pencil sized round hole in our living room bamboo floors. I thought maybe we had dropped something and damaged the floor, though the shape of the hole was extremely smooth. We just didn't know what to think of it. Maybe 3 weeks after that we notice a new hole, still in the living room, maybe 3 feet from the original hole, but this time we notice the wood dust around it. Immediately my heart sank. I started searching online and found out that there are wood-boring beetles that can infest the hardwood floors even before installation and the larvae can take years to develop into beetles. I called a pest company but they told me they don't deal with wood beetles. 
Today I found another new hole. I also hear the clicking in the wood, which, according to my research, means there are more active beetles feeding on the wood. 

I see different solutions and responses online: some say you need to wait until all beetles have emerged to then change the affected wood and seal it, some say you need to sand the floors and treat it with borax like solution. Who do I call about this? What do I do? I'm really concerned as I have no idea how many more of these beetles are in the floors. 

We bought the house about a year ago and there were no signs of this Infestation in the floors when we bought it. 

Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? What did you do? Any and all advice is much appreciated. 

Thank you

Dishwasher Repair Question Hello,

I recently moved into an apartment and noticed that after running a cycle in my dishwasher, my dishes were not drying properly, and there were black particles sticking to my plates.

I opened up my dishwasher and noticed that there is a rubber gasket that is full or water and residue.

I am unable to remove it.  Even when prying with a screwdriver.  It budges but won‚Äôt fully remove.

Do you know what this piece is called?  Should it be replaced or do I need to do something else?  If I should replace it how do I get it out?  Thank you.

DIY Damp Rid Anybody ever made their own damprid? I googled some, active ingredient is calcium chloride. Calcium chloride is also main ingredient in ice melting, like pellets of fire etc, which is waaay cheaper. I got some and put it in a mesh sieve with a bucket under it. The top sort of melted together/congealed. Question is how to prevent this? I tried another one mixing with rock salt, which also attracts moisture, same thing happened. I have a dehumidifier but even with that on 24/7, the 4 damprid closet bags were full in 2.5 weeks! I want something that i can use in a larger format that will last at least a month before i need to empty/refill, hence the bucket sized diy. Any ideas?
Want to install new faucet, afraid of cutting our counter. As the title states, I want to install a counter faucet for filtered water. Our city‚Äôs water is not great and everyone filters. We just us a Brita but I‚Äôd like something more substantial that is also easier to access.

The problem for me (being semi-handy at a few things and not handy at a great many other things) is that installing one of these faucets requires cutting a hole in our countertop. The counter is not granite or marble (I‚Äôm not entirely sure what the material is, it‚Äôs definitely less expensive but still solid) but I‚Äôm still extremely nervous about making any cut/drill/hole of any kind. 

Is this something a regular homeowner can do? Or is this something I need to get installed professionally?

Mold and Human Health: a Reality Check There are just so many panicky posts made here with "OMG is this mold what do i do I have a BABY!"

Mold isn't "nature's plutonium."  The "dangers" of mold have been incredibly overhyped in the media and there are plenty of companies out there preying on the folks that fall for the hysteria.  The hype is clearly effective based on the multiple daily "is this mold" posts seen here.

\- *reports of ‚Äútoxic mold syndrome‚Äù or ‚Äútoxic black mold‚Äù have been shown to be* ***no more than media hype and mass hysteria****, partly stemming from the misinterpreted concept of the ‚Äúsick building syndrome.* 

\- *There is* ***no scientific evidence*** *that exposure to visible black mold in apartments and buildings can lead to the vague and subjective symptoms of memory loss, inability to focus, fatigue, and headaches that were reported by people who* ***erroneously believed*** *that they were suffering from ‚Äúmycotoxicosis."*

\- *a causal relationship (that says CAUSAL, not CASUAL) between cases of infant pulmonary hemorrhage and exposure to ‚Äúblack mold‚Äù has* ***never been proven****.* 

\- *there is* ***no evidence*** *of a link between autoimmune disease and mold exposure.*

Incorrect slope of shower Hello, recently purchased home. Doing a major renovation and decided to save showers for another time. They are not that bad, recently renovated but done cheaply. Anyway since the house is about 80% done, pool is still cut up and back yard destroyed I really don‚Äôt want to start another expensive project. We just finished installation of hardwood floor and in master bath I alway see water on the floor. I ran the shower and whoever tiled the shower did not tilt tiles toward shower pan so water leaks under glass door, out on the floor. And then conveniently makes a dash straight pot the newly installed wood floors in master bedroom. It‚Äôs such a dumb installation. 
I don‚Äôt want another project, wife is ready to loose it since pool was supposed to be done later, it looked ok, but I convinced her to do it now before we moved it. As it always goes, drains were all bad so more cutting up concrete, more plumbers, and cost is much higher than anticipated. Back to the shower question, other than ripping up tiles, is there a seal I can install temporary to meet the glass door or I was thinking to rtv clear piece of triangular plastic to make artificial slope. Anyone see anything like this before?

Repairs or upgrades to terrace and stoop Attached to our recently purchased house is a two-car garage made of concrete. The roof of the garage is a terrace, which can be reached from a door in the kitchen or from outside via a large concrete stoop next to the garage.

There are some problems: First, the surface of terrace appears to be degraded (not to mention painted pink), and water tends to pool in these areas after rainfall. Second, there is evidence the stoop is falling apart and separating from the garage. A home inspector suggested it would need to be rebuilt (or replaced, perhaps with stairs instead of a stoop?). Finally, and perhaps as a consequence of one or both of the previous problems, there is water leaking from thin cracks in the ceiling of the garage.

My suspicion is the stoop needs to be replaced completely, whereas the garage is structurally fine but the terrace needs to be resealed or resurfaced or something. As we think about doing that, the priority is structural integrity, but it would be nice if we also could upgrade the appearance of the terrace, perhaps by adding stamped concrete atop the existing terrace surface.

Masonite siding and installing a new dryer vent My existing dryer vent is in very bad shape. I‚Äôm looking to replace it. I‚Äôm fairly handy. Usually I‚Äôd use some outdoor rated caulk on the new vent when installing but on this house .. the siding is Masonite.

Am I ok to seal the new vent with something like DAP dynaflex on the Masonite siding? From what I can see I need to treat this siding with care.

I think the correct thing to fill this gap with is some sand and cement, and then lay a waterproof board on top. Something like [this](https://www.diy.com/departments/aquadry-waterproof-board-l-1200mm-w-600mm-t-12mm/259514_BQ.prd). What do folks think?

Upgrading mobile home, advice needed Hi All

First time poster here so I hope this kind of thread is allowed.

Looking for a little guidance on selecting a new 2nd hand mobile. I live in a private park beside the sea and inherited a mobile from family about 4 years ago. It's served me well, however it's quite small and I think it's time an upgrade is done. Most of the 2nd hand mobiles available were over 35k and just totally out of my price range over the last few years, so I haven't been looking properly. 

Recently, some new ones became available and 3 of them were under 20k which meant I was finally able to potentially get one. One in particular, a 2008 BK Seville 3 Bed, is exactly what I am looking for. Great size and layout, the only issue being it's not galvanised. Having had a look at the chassis it's quite rusted and the only way to get a mobile into the park is via a crane. So a slight concern.

Had a look at a galvanised mobile today (2006 Willerby Winchester, 2 bed) which was around 23500. The seller has agreed to put new carpet in and replace the boiler which is included in that price. The only issue with this one is the layout isn't as good and particularly the kitchen hasn't got a huge amount of space (which was one of the reasons why I am replacing my current one).

My main question is, is it being galvanised a major thing? With the sea air blowing directly at the mobile, it does factor in to the decision, but I want to make sure that it does make the most sense to go with the one I saw today before I spend an additional 4k I wasn't planning on.

Thanks very much

Foundation leak New home owner. Terrible condition, previous owners were hoarders. Found massive damage in basement from foundation crack, heavy black mold in washroom. I believe the main water line under the house is leaking. I am a bit concerned as I can see house settling in the corner. Drains were heavily restricted from shingle rock, roof needs to be repaired ASAP. Who would I call to detect water leaking from main city to house?
Cracked shower stall grout - need advice please! I know that my shower stall will probably need to be completely retiled. Hopefully there isn't already moisture behind the tiles (fingers crossed).  However, a full shower stall re-do is not financially possible for 6 months to a year.  I need advice for temporary fix in the interim. Can I fill this with chaulking or grout for now?  In the meantime, I really only use the bathtub. I use the shower in our other bathroom 90% of the time. If I ever do use this shower I keep the water aimed away and then squeegee the water off the walls.

Hard water stains on glass shower doors. Nothing is working. Help! Okay, I‚Äôve tried everything the internet had suggested: vinegar, straight denatured alcohol, vinegar and dish soap, the specialty glass scrub/polishes, baking soda paste/lemon juice, etc. Nothing touches the water spots! 

When we had the glass installed we paid extra for a protective coating that clearly didn‚Äôt work. 

Am I missing anything that might work, or am I just stuck with these spots?

Selling home before listing So I have a long term realtor and we have staged the house but have not taken pictures or listed it. The offer came directly to me from a neighbors friend.

Is this proper placement of existing roof flashing under new plywood sheathing? We're installing new Hardie Lap Siding on our 1920s house, part of that process is to add plywood sheathing to the walls, tyvek wrap, and new trim & fascias. I want to be sure the flashing (especially on our second floor dormers where the roof meets the siding) is done properly so there is not water intrusion later on. We're not replacing the roof at the same time (couldn't afford it), but plan to within the next 2 years or so.
 Is this existing step flashing supposed to be under the new plywood or over it and under the tyvek? Is there any other flashing we should add that will make the process of replacing the roof and flashing easier when we do that? I read I could/should maybe do counter flashing or z flashing under the hardie so that step flashing could be easily slipped under when the roof us replaced without destroying the new siding, is that the proper way? Sorry I don't know that much about all this but just want it done right.
Wasps nest somewhere under the deck How do you go about locating and destroying a lost mass underneath rather deep and shallow deck? My wife has been saying something about seeing wasps and I haven't really been paying attention but today I was mowing the grass around the deck and got investigated by two wasps that I watched fly underneath the deck. Any help or tips would be appreciated
Stain/paint under deck I have a deck on the 2nd story that covers a 1st story patio.  I had to have it rebuilt to correct some water leakage issues.  I would like to stain or paint it to get all the wood types to match, and to hide some of the water damage from the previous leaks.

Currently thinking a solid stain in a darker brown color, but curious on anybody else's thoughts on color and type of stain paint that might look good here?

Looking for ideas to repair this failing retaining wall Can‚Äôt really dig down on the other side due to neighbors shrubs, just hoping to patch it up and get it to last a little while longer
What would be a likely cause for these cracks/discoloration? So my wife and I recently moved upstairs to our loft after installing a ductless minisplit and painting the walls of the loft. Previously it was too hot to live up here but now that we have the minisplit and were able to repaint the walls, the space is much more comfortable. I just noticed this crack start to form on our wall below our skylight. The prior owner had replaced the skylight a few years ago due to leaking so I‚Äôm concerned that the issue might not have been fixed. I attached a few photographs of the crack and the discoloration. Note that the walls were completely white a few months ago. What do you all think is causing this? How can I investigate this further without sawing a hole in the wall and looking through the crawl space.

Why would I have cardboard at the top of the wall? Purchased the home in October. The top of the wall in a very shittily built addition has separated slightly revealing cardboard. There is a strip of 1‚Äù where there isn‚Äôt cardboard, and it seems whoever built this portion of the home just painted over it and the gap to ‚Äúseal‚Äù the wall. 

Is this common practice? How can I fix the separation?

Flooded Crawlspace We live in a manufactured double wide home. Recently the crawlspace flooded bringing a lot of silt and mud in. I‚Äôve popped off a good amount of skirting, and let air move under the house to help dry things. I‚Äôve read that using a dehumidifier helps. Seems like it would have to be sealed back up so it‚Äôs not just dehumidifying the air in general. If anyone has experience with this and can help, I‚Äôm wondering which path makes more sense to dry it for cleanup. 

1. Leave the skirting off and let the air moving under the house dry what‚Äôs on the slab. 

2. Put the skirt back on and get a dehumidifier in a central location under there with a hose running out to drain it. 

Thanks I‚Äôm advance for any help.

AC tech foot went through ceiling AC tech stepped on a 2x4 while working in attic and it went through the ceiling. Luckily he did not! 

The company sent out a contractor to patch and paint the wall, and when he asked if we had paint, we gave him some from the garage, saying we weren't sure if it was it, but it said ceiling paint and it was white. So we all assumed. 

Now that it's dry we can tell the difference between the old paint and the new paint/ or maybe it's the texture?- it's a lot more dramatic difference in person.

Is this on us for not having the right paint? Or should ac company still fix this? I feel bad since it was obviously an accident on their part, but not sure the move.

PVC roof outgassing after 7 years Last summer, I had a mysterious pungent chemical odor in my condo (we're the bottom floor of a three story building). We called everyone we could think of. No mold, no rodents, no gas leak, no electrical issue, no plumbing issue, no appliance issue.  It disappeared during the winter and is back again with a vengeance this summer.  It's in our backyard, and we can't open the windows. We smell it strongest on the roof.

In desperation, we called out a roofer and he said that the flat PVC roof of the building was outgassing like crazy. He said it's super unusual and disturbing and he basically got off our roof as quickly as possible. There are cypress trees bordering our condo that might trap it in our area. The problem is, when I brought it to the attention of the HOA president, she said that the roof always smells like that and it's "how the building smells." The smell in our apartment she labeled as "building smell" too. She's been in the building for 8 years and there was a new roof put in 7 years ago. Has anyone had a similar experience with their PVC roof and how did they resolve it and/or prove that it was an issue?   
Outdoor floodlights stopped working. Options? It's one housing with 2 bulbs.  One day they worked, the next day nothing.  I confirmed the bulbs still work, and no breakers are tripped.

Door installation tools / jigs ? A while back I replaced an exterior door and that was a lengthy painful experience of banging against frames, shimming, drilling and wedging, trying to get things semi-level in a house that does not have too many level reference surfaces.

Anyway, now it's time to replace the interior garage door / fire door and I am wondering if there are ways to make this a better experience. Growing up in Germany we had a couple of jigs and adjustable hinges that would make this easier like the one shown in the video below. Are there similar tools here in the US I could use?

Basement egress We are looking at purchasing a home that has no basement windows at all. It has access to the basement through the main house, and bulkhead doors to the outside. My spouse would want to finish the basement if we purchase this house. Can a basement without windows be legally finished in most states?

Hello everyone, I am a first time homebuyer and am heavily considering this home. The only thing I am concerned with is possible foundation issues.

It is a beautiful home, I would just like some opinions before getting under contract and committing to inspection and option costs.
Want To Take Down Popcorn Ceiling, Don‚Äôt Know If It Has Asbestos I want to take down the popcorn from the ceiling of my bedroom. I‚Äôm putting almost everything in my closet (I don‚Äôt have much stuff) and the remaining things are being pushed to the corner of my room. I‚Äôm currently putting up painters plastic all the way to the top of the walls and I‚Äôm putting double layers. My father told me the house was built in 1977.

Here the thing though:

I asked my father if we have asbestos, he says no. He used to work with asbestos removal back in the 80‚Äôs for years and says he can tell if it is or isn‚Äôt. Apparently if you soak it with water, you can see a different water pattern and like very tiny shiny materials (I‚Äôm assuming the small fibers). My parents also removed the popcorn ceiling already in another bedroom years ago and I don‚Äôt remember them having it tested. I wanted to see how it looked when soaked so we sprayed some of the kitchen ceiling with water and let it soak. It just looked like soaked popcorn ceiling, I then touched it and it felt soft. 

Also, a while back we had someone come out to check our house for rodents, they checked everywhere including the attic. My mother pointed out that they cannot go into the attic if we had asbestos. 

Now yes, I can and should get it tested but if it were positive, that means I would have to pay to get it professionally removed. If that‚Äôs the case I‚Äôll just leave it. I want to take it down but I‚Äôm not 100% sure. What should I do?
Water Leak garage / Hole fondation wall Hi,

I started seeing water in my garage after weeks of rain. I located the source and I opened up the wall to have a view on the concrete. 

I put a hose outside to see where the water is coming in the inside. It seems like the water is from what seems like a premade hole that was filled with some wood material (picture attached).

 After looking online this is apparently a drain hole to reduce hydraulic pressure but usually there is a drainage track below it, but here it seems it would just leak there. Am I getting this right ? And how should I fix this ?

Thanks a lot !
How do I remove this oil-based wood stain from my driveway? I spilled oil-based wood stain on a concrete driveway. I thought that pressure washing would be the best solution, but a guy at Lowe's told me that pressure washing wouldn't work because concrete is porous. He suggested applying paint remover with a brush, but I'm concerned that 1) applying stain remover and brushing will actually spread the stain and 2) that the 100-degree heat would greatly reduce the efficacy of the stain remover because of its volatility.   


What do y'all suggest?
Basement foundation problem, any suggestions? After about an inch of water in my basement, I tore out the paneling previous owner had placed over the concrete wall of my foundation, and found the probable source of the water, a 3 foot long crack in the concrete. Is there a way to fix this from the inside of the basement?
Would this LP Smartside paneling be appropriate to cover our open eaves? I own an older home that we're currently doing work on (new insulation, plywood, and hardie fiber cement lap siding). Part of the scope of work is to also replace fascias and cover the open eaves/soffits with new planks since they are caked in old textured paint, split in many areas and have nails through them (not a good look). I want to keep them open (no attic vents in soffits only gables and whirlybirds). My original plan was to use hardie planks there but recently discovered [this LP Smartside paneling](https://www.homedepot.com/p/LP-SmartSide-SmartSide-38-Series-8-in-Application-as-4-ft-x-8-ft-Cedar-Texture-OC-Panel-Engineered-Treated-Wood-Siding-27874/100055901?source=shoppingads&locale=en-US&&mtc=SHOPPING-RM-RMP-GGL-D21-021_002_SIDING-MB-LP_SMARTSIDE-NA-SMART-NA-NA-MK683022200-NA-NBR-371-NA-NA-NA&cm_mmc=SHOPPING-RM-RMP-GGL-D21-021_002_SIDING-MB-LP_SMARTSIDE-NA-SMART-NA-NA-MK683022200-NA-NBR-371-NA-NA-NA-71700000085038081-58700007206164707-92700075444410741&gclid=CjwKCAjwtuOlBhBREiwA7agf1ooojngUYtHrvMH4gYUJsRi3WBIzNaXUWEaL6o-5wY6ubKY3wLbQBBoCVjoQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) which may be easier to install and better looking for this area.

Next home update recommendations (warning: long post) Seeking recommendations for my next updates!

I purchased a home in 2013. For background, it was built in the late 60s, is a one-level 1000 sq ft. ranch home with a walk out garage and basement. I am a single female, 40 yrs old, and plan to keep this home indefinitely. Electrical panel was updated/installed before moving in. Boiler and hot water heater were purchased in 2008 and I've been told are solid and best quality. Roof was replaced the year I moved in. I have oil heat and natural gas for stove/oven. I have never had any issues with flooding or required major repairs. It's a solid home. Over the years, I've made solid investments on my home to continue making it my forever home, and would love recommendations for my next update(s) as you would prioritize them.

As I am planning to keep my home indefinitely, I am not necessarily looking for pure ROI or resale value. I simply want to update and maximize the value and usage of my home for years to come to set myself up for a very happy and comfortable retirement.

Updates in the last ten years included:

\- Installed a high-efficient wood stove for free backup heat. I've been able to source free firewood for the last decade.

\- Renovated the one bathroom before moving in with marble tile for floor, dual flush toilet, cast iron tub/shower with subway tile.

\- Sanded/refinished wood flooring throughout home.

\- Insulation ceiling of basement and in attic. Weather-stripping & caulking and sealing. Pipes insulated. My last home energy audit gave me a top score.

\- LED's throughout home. New thermostat.

\- Ripped out overgrown hedges and a border of old spiny overgrown hedges I HATED. Replaced with native perennials and roses.

\- Installed fencing around property for dogs and chickens. Front yard raised garden beds to maximize solar energy (too shady in back yard). Planted fruit trees all around home (apple, cherry, pear, mulberry, fig, and elderberry). Planted blueberry bushes and currants, asparagus bed and rhubarb. Two rain barrels for watering plants and emergency non-potable water source.

\- Added a new patio door directly onto deck into backyard, providing more light into kitchen and easier access to backyard for dogs.

\- Paid for solar panels. Installed a solar battery bank this year for backup electric source when power goes out.

\- Repainted outside home. (general maintenance). Repainted all interior walls.

\- Replaced all windows with Andersen renewal.

\- Replaced appliances over time with the best that I could afford, including washer and new gas oven/stove. New organic mattresses and frames.

\- Invested in quality wood furniture and new upholstery.

&#x200B;

As with any home ownership, I still have many items on the list to complete over time. What would you prioritize if you were me? Is there anything not on this list you would work on that I haven't mentioned?

\- Remove asphalt driveway and replace with permeable pavers. Currently the driveway is bumpy, cracked, and long overdue for replacement.

\- Replace asphalt paths leading to front and side door with stone pavers.

\- Renovate kitchen with ceramic or stone tile (currently vinyl), new counters and cupboards (I painted original and updated hardware, but they are tired), and tile backsplash. Update lighting.

\- Mini splits. I currently cool the home with a single window AC unit and heat with oil and woodstove. I would like to reduce or eliminate oil heat, especially given my solar investment.

\- Solar water heater. Again, to reduce or eliminate the need for oil.

\- Renovate basement into a living space/home gym with better lighting and flooring (epoxy would be fine)

\- Clean out and renovate garage. New epoxy flooring. Remove all the wooden shelves built by previous owner and install heavy duty shelving for storage space. Bring up to code with better doors leading to basement. I was told by initial inspector that the current doors are not currently up to code to allow a vehicle to park in garage.

\- Power wash awning and deck, reseal deck and replace broken and worn boards.

\- Replace indoor hollow doors with solid wood doors. Replace exterior wood doors (front door has a slight crack) with Andersen by Renewal.

&#x200B;

TL/DR: I am looking for recommendations for my next home project as I have the money to do so. Forever home looking to continue updating to maximize value and usage of property, not necessarily ROI.

ETA: Pictures and captions.

Moving into a house - what‚Äôs something fun we can enjoy that we couldn‚Äôt in apartments? After 10 years in apartments we‚Äôre finally moving into a (rented) house. What are things we couldn‚Äôt easily have in apartments that we can now appreciate in a house?

I was thinking maybe a grill or a small inflatable pool. 

Nothing too permanent as we are still only renting.
Windows improvement on a budget. Hi there, I have these old windows that are awful but I can‚Äôt pony up 10k to get them replace this year. 

Any improvements that I can make ? I‚Äôm gonna pressure wash the metal beddings and add more insulation but there are no wheels on these windows so the sliding motion is awful.


How much water does your household use? This just doesn‚Äôt seem right. I‚Äôve always thought my water bill was a lot but the last two months it‚Äôs gone up significantly more. 

In the household it‚Äôs my wife and I and our three kids (8yo, 3yo, 1yo) plus a dog and two cats. Typically our bill is around $80 for 6,500-8,000 gallons a month. I feel like that‚Äôs already high but I just don‚Äôt have a frame of reference. But the last two months our bill has been for $120-135 each with 10,500-11,700 gallons of use. This isn‚Äôt normal is it?
Finishing my unfinished garage Okay so I have an unfinished garage that I want to finish. Going to insulate, add some drywall, and a mini split for AC/heat. 

Currently the garage gets blasted with sun and gets very hot. It has one window but i‚Äôm looking for advice on how/if I should add other ventilation.

Any other garage finishing tips appreciated! Thanks.
Gap between driveway and garage As picture above, there appears to be a gap between the garage and driveway. Not sure what original material here is. Almost feels like wood. Worth it to try and fill it in? If so, would caulk be fine?
Oven Clicking On/Off Bake Cycle Evey 5-15 Seconds When Baking Oven is 17 years old: Kenmore 790.96019405

Symptoms: When baking say, 375 degrees, the oven bake light comes on and it heats up. Once is reaches operating temperature, it clicks off like it should. However, it is now clicking off, then back on, then on, then back off, every 5-15 seconds. Much more frequently than normal.

My thinking is:

* Oven is able to heat to temperature
* Oven is then thinking it isn't up to temperature, and kicks back on, then kicks back off when it is at temperature again.

This leads me to believe these are possible scenarios:

* Actually getting to temp, and too much venting is happening, so it kicks back on. (Seems unlikely, I don't believe this oven has a fan and we aren't experiencing massive air leaks randomly.)
* Oven is getting to temp but is getting too hot due to blocked vents, then air vents out, then it needs to heat up again. I think this would lead to it being "off bake" for longer period of time to allow for the hot air to escape, not on/off/on/off very frequently.
* Oven is not actually getting to temp due to misunderstanding of the temperature in the oven (seems unlikely, we baked some bread at the correct temp and it came out fine and at correct temperature.)
* The control board is misinterpreting what the temperature probe is saying the temperature is or is having some other malfunction.

I have pulled the probe out, tested the two ports of the connector on the probe for resistance with my multimeter and got a 1.085 kOhms reading. My understanding is that is 1,085 ohms. From what I've read, probes should be between 900 and 1200 ohms. I tested for continuity from one of the ports to the body of the probe, no beep, so (I think, I am just a DIYer Googling here) that is correct because it isn't plugged in and "on". If I got continuity, that would indicate something wrong with the probe... I think?

One review of a replacement probe said it fixed the exact same symptoms.

I have no idea how to test the control board. We aren't getting in "F03" or "F10" or "F30" codes like I have seen on some Q&A websites. The stove top works for heating up pans, etc. Clock works. Doesn't seem to have a problem. I have visually inspected the board while installed in the oven, and don't see any obvious signs of a burnt-out component.

I have checked the vent where it comes out above the stove top, there were a few crusty bits but it doesn't appear blocked. We have done a pathetic job keeping the oven clean, so willing to do a self-clean cycle if it is safe to do so.

I have ordered a returnable board via Amazon to expedite fix if that is what it is, but looking for some guidance. Is there a chance the probe is bad even though it is reading correct ohms resistance? Could it be something else like when the oven starts to draw more power, there is a problem with the plug... or the breaker... or something like that? How would I test?

Trying to avoid a $200 diagnostic visit... oven is old, not looking to just spend lots of money for a replacement, but also need an oven and don't want to replace all the parts and still not have a fix.

&#x200B;

Edit: also, visual inspection of the connections at the rear all look good aside from the light bulb socket, when has lots of brown on it. Not sure if there is a weird chance that the socket is malfunctioning and confusing the control board. The light turns on, works fine, etc.

How do I fix my fence? I have several fallen board on my fence that I cannot get to because my neighbor had a fence put up at the edge of their property line and now neither of us can fix fallen/broken planks.

I think I can put the board in place like normal and use screws from the inside going out. Not sure if this will work though.

What‚Äôs going on with these frames? 1968 vintage home on the east coast. Moved in last year and noticed the door and window frame top is bowing. 

The door and window are in rooms next to each other. The front door and bathroom window. It‚Äôs a split level with this bathroom on the lower level but the window is 2-3 ft above dirt. Above it is the upstairs bathroom, same configuration, higher ceiling but not bowing.

Thoughts?

Does my home have good thermal efficiency? I am trying to figure out if my home is efficient. 

We have put a lot of work on:

* Attic insulation (R38) 
* Attic fan
* Minimizing direct sunlight by shading walls
* Blinds on skylights 
* Blocking chimney vents

&#x200B;

The numbers you see below are at the end of the day without the use of the AC (temperature sensor is in a shaded area on the north side of the house). How does it compare with the average home in this sub?

 We usually start the day with 68 degrees inside (thank god for cold nights). 

Is there anything else that can be improved?

Noob Diyer with Toilet Tank Leak Hey everyone.  I'm a noob Diyer who is tackling a toilet tank leak.  I looked at videos replaced the bolts as they were rusty, the gasket as that was old and wearing out and the supply line since that was old and stiff. 
The gasket and supply line are fine now, but I'm having a problem with a leak out of the back bolt of the tank.

I tried tightening the back bolt but there are still some leakes.  Also I feel like the gasket is gonna get crushed.  I used the korky 3 bolt kit that included the gasket.  Here's a pic of the gasket and angle the toilet tank is in.  I didn't want it to be that slanted towards the back but it was the only way to prevent the leak.  Should I just keep tightening all the screws and put more pressure on the gasket, or is there something else that could help.  Or is it possible there's a problem with the tank?

The toilet tank 14 years old from the date stamp in the tank. Any help would be great!

Replacing a Piece of Siding Hello, I'd like to replace a piece of vinyl siding. I have an unzipper tool, but it seems like the tool is too big to get all the way into the joint to actually hook onto anything. I've tried forcing it in, but get the same results everytime- the tool just comes right out when I pull down and out. I was wondering if there are alternative methods to get a piece of siding off, or if I'm doing anything wrong. The sidiing is vinyl, traditional lap. The house was built in the 1980s, but I'm not sure if this the original siding.
Bathroom - Paint Issue or Something Else? Recently noticed our bathroom paint is bubbling up (see pics)

We moved in here a couple of years ago and everything looked great, but the bathroom is quickly deteriorating. The bathroom doesn‚Äôt have a fan, so we had to start opening the window when we shower because it gets very humid and wet in there. 

Did the original owners just use the wrong type of paint that might not be water/mildew resistant or is there something else going on here? 

Any advice is appreciated.
How do you find fly nests or otherwise how they‚Äôre getting in So I‚Äôm a renter, and I‚Äôve lived here for only a year or so. This summer I‚Äôm finding increasing numbers of flies in my kitchen. Everything time I come home I find like, 9 flies on my kitchen windows, opposite of the sink and cabinets. I‚Äôve looked around at the sink, anywhere there might be the chance of rotten food, inside my garbage can, etc. I haven‚Äôt found anywhere a fly might come in, nor have I found maggots. It‚Äôs driving me crazy. The pic is of my kitchen, the windows where these assholes like to congregate. I‚Äôll have to get traps or something this weekend, but any advice would be great

Trailer, cleaning under and likely dead animals‚Ä¶ Title. It‚Äôs a trailer. I‚Äôm pretty sure there are cats living underneath it and I‚Äôve seen them drag in mice and rabbits. Kittens also seem to be missing, I‚Äôm not sure if predators got them, or they died underneath.

A relative passed away and while the trailer itself is nice, the space underneath obviously has issues.

The gap in skirting has an odor of trash/rotting, and I don‚Äôt have as much time as I‚Äôd like.

I‚Äôm planning on using an air horn to flush out the cats. And dousing it in vinegar from a pump sprayer before I make the trip under it next spring to clean it all out.

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has better options, has experience in dealing with something similar, or would just have a better suggestion.

It‚Äôs rural. Animal control is not an option. I‚Äôm not there enough to justify live traps (if I could even find 7 of them to use), and I‚Äôd like to be as ethical as possible in dealing with the problem.

I‚Äôd appreciate ***any*** other options from someone who has more experience than me.

Need advice on gates Hi, UK resident here so hardware options may be different.

I have designed a gate to go on a doubly sloping driveway entrance (road slope as well as driveway slope up) and I‚Äôm planning on using adjustable hinges so the gate leaves slant up when open (see image).

Problem is that despite my detailed schematics, wife can‚Äôt visualise what they will look like when open (it‚Äôs important as they will mostly sit open during the day). I can‚Äôt find anything online, it‚Äôs almost like people don‚Äôt want to talk about it! All gates are photographed shut.

Help with this paint edge discovery So I pulled off a small kitchen window sill edge (behind the sink) to allow me to more easily tile in the future, and I found the paint edge underneath and all the coats are loose in a spot and could be yanked off the backing. How far off, I‚Äôm scared to find out! From that starting place in the pic, you could at least start pulling it off like a sheet of paper.

What‚Äôs the best way to tackle this, we just added a primer coat and two flat coats to these layers last month, in flat latex paint. It‚Äôs an older house (50s), and my plans for a kitchen tile backsplash now seem in jeopardy if, what I thought, was a solidly smooth and clean painted surface is actually a liability for holding any weight up.

How should I address this? Chip, peel, and scrape away til it stops and then sand, skim some compound, and prime?

Thanks for any advice!

Pooling Water - Proposed Solutions Thanks to the help of everyone, I think I have two proposed solutions to tackle the pooling water I have (my home): https://imgur.com/a/tUXV3IE 

1) Use some floor leveler on the roof felt, then perhaps cover it with more felt


2) Lay some wood down, cover that with felt

The wood idea seems best as using the level material seems like it will be hard to control the slope. Either way I need to cover both in new felt to protect it, curious what type of felt I should use, from Googling it's not clear. 

Very much appreciate everyone's help!

Ice box Does anyone have a updated guide to ice making and storage?

My cellar stays around 38-40 degrees year round. Not cold enough to make ice so I'm making it on the surface during winter.

Should I just plan on making new ice every winter to meet my summer needs?

Termite Control I bought my house in 2020 towards the end of the year, and the inspector mentioned there were visible signs of termites in the backyard.

We got the previous homeowners to do a chemical barrier of sorts around the house and then the summer of 2021 we paid about 2k to have a pest control company install termite poison traps around the perimeter of our house and yard. Pricy, but they told us we would be under warranty. The brand is Sentricon.

Every year since then they do an annual inspection and add more poison traps, and this comes out to be at least $300 a year.

Money is tight and I was wondering if this was a common way to deal with termites and how other people are handling termites. I'm a bit annoyed with the company as they tried to get me to do their fancy ~pest proof insulation~ back in February and they wanted 21k for that. I didn't bite.
Moisture on insulation We have an unfinished basement. You can see the pink insulation on the exterior walls, covered in plastic. 

I noticed that there are some areas that have moisture on the inside of the plastic... It makes the insulation look like cotton candy.

Just wondering if it's a time to worry or not.. first house so we are learning but hoping that it's not expensive!

Pink Dots Growing On Wood Patio Wall? I spotted tiny pink dots growing on a few boards of an outdoor patio wall where they meet the ground (other wooden boards).

Nail Pops I had my siding done recently which caused several nail pops on the interior walls in regards to the drywall

I have been watching YouTube videos about fixing them and it seems pretty easy to do. 

Most of what I watched mentioned to put two screws. One above the nail pop and another one below the nail pop. 

My question is that since I have several of them and also on the same stud, would I be running the risk of splitting the stud if I am going to be screwing several screws on the same stud? 

Also, my second question is if I am putting two screws on above and below of each nail pop, does it matter what I do to the existing nail pop? Whether that is hammering it back in, replacing it with another screw or just taking it out?

HVAC American standard freedom 78 question Hello everyone and thanks in advance. My blower motor and capacitor needs replaced on my 25ish year old furnace. I was told by the technician they can put a ‚Äúrescue blower?‚Äù in as they obviously don‚Äôt make this part anymore. 

He stated that it would only last 3 months to 2 years before needing replaced again and I should maybe look into getting the furnace replaced? This seems strange to me. The first blower lasted 25 years and if i go the replace blower option I‚Äôll pay ~1k dollars and it may only work from 3 months to 2 years? Thanks for any insight!
passing through window Just saw the post of [Bobby](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CuC4t-Isnwy/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) of his passing through window and I was wondering if anyone has one  and if they would recommend it?   


I think it would be fun to have the option to pass food through when I have a bbq with friends. I also like that I can air out the kitchen even more especially in case I cook something with a strong smell.   


would love to hear y'alls opinion. :)
Need Help With Dryer Outlet What is this prong set called? All the dryer wires I find have the circle prong up top but this has a square one in the middle. I can not find a wire for it.
Hole under clean out waste pipe cap- how big of an issue is this? I recently moved into this house and found a hole basically under the cap of the clean out pipe. It‚Äôs in an area where water could pool, so I feel that the previous owner may have done this intentionally to prevent water from pooling right next to the foundation. 

How big of a deal is this, is it something I should get fixed asap?
How should I go about repairing this? It‚Äôs a doorknob dent. Do I need to use some sort of filler first? Seems too deep to just spread drywall mud over. 
I have pooling water on the balcony, what is the best way to slope it to stop this? Thanks! 
door jamb weather stripping advice Looking to better seal our exterior door from the elements. I can see daylight from a corner of the door. There is worn weather stripping currently that would be good to replace.

Could I add [this product](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/m-d-building-products-2-x-82-inch-1-x-36-inch-vinyl-spring-loaded-top-sides-door-jamb-weather-stripping-set-white/1001120739) in addition to the existing worn weather stripping? Or would this product replace the need for this stripping entirely?

I like the idea of the spring loaded jamb and the install looks very easy.

Thinking I can just screw it into the metal casing around the door.

Long time lurker but first time poster.....loving the community.

Happy home maintenance to all! :)

Which A/C are best for longevity Just had my AC serviced. The tech said if I want my A/C to work better and last longer I should switch from the HDX (mid grade home depot brand) filters to the cheap green walmart filters because they allow more air flow. 

Which filters are best for the A/C?
What‚Äôs wrong with my energy bill!!! I‚Äôve been paying an average of about 650 a month for electricity since moving into my new house and I still can‚Äôt figure out what‚Äôs wrong! Am I being charged too much? My pool consumes as much energy as the average household in my area. Could there be an issue with the panel? Any help would be appreciated! Images of my energy bill as well as monitored consumption is attached.

Closet connected to attic smells musty. Is there anything I can do to make my clothes not stink? The ceiling lifts off the closet to get into the attic. I think the musty/old people smell may be coming from there.

I painted the closet with odor sealing primer, but it still smells musty inside. I‚Äôve also tried those baking soda balls to get rid of scents, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping enough. I don‚Äôt want my clothes to smell! Is there anything else I can do?
Leaking Drain After Re-pipe Leaking Again After Re-Pipe

10 Months ago we hired a Plumbing Company to solve a bad water leak under our mobile home. They did a full re-pipe and installed a new drain under our bathtub. 3 weeks later they finished and they said it was done.

Now it appears to be leaking again. Just wondering if this is something the Plumbing Company should fix, considering its still under a year since they did the job. Paid them way too much money for this to be happening and am at a loss.
Flooded Crawlspace I have a flood related question. Our crawlspace was flooded very recently. The water left a lot of mud and silt on the slab. Since this is a major disaster, the companies that deal with this sort of thing are booked out for weeks. The affected area is about 1700ft.  I'm trying to dry the space out to prevent mold, and get started on some cleanup while we wait for the pros. We've had two schools of thought:  
1. Pop a lot of the skirting off and let air move under the house, which I've currently done.   
2. Invest in a dehumidifier that fits under the house.  


I'm thinking if we go the dehumidifier route, the skirting should be put back in place so the dehumidifier can do it's job. Otherwise, it's just pulling moisture of the atmosphere and not under the house. Thanks to anyone who has any thoughts on this. 
Window AC has been leaking through porch cellar door into basement. Today while emptying the dehumidifier in my basement I heard dripping in the stairs that lead to my side porch. I'll include pics, these stairs look very run down. House was purchased like this, and was not deemed to be a problem for foundations through a reliable inspector (same guy I use for all home purchases). 

Anyways, the window AC sits just above the cellar door to the basement. It seems to have been leaking for a considerable time. I see some pretty bad mold and am treating with hydrogen peroxide. I turned off the AC unit, cleaned the filter, and wiped away and air dusted as much moisture as possible on the unit and window frame. I also move the dehumidifer to be as close to this portion of the stairs as possible. But, the ground here is quite moist. 

I guess my question is, what else do I need to do to handle this situation? I am worried about long lasting damage. But, I cannot afford to do much right now. I have experienced several emergencies over the past month that have left me drained of savings and living paycheck to pay check. Things feel very hopeless right now. 

Pics:

I'll start with the money shot: here's [the worst of the mold](https://i.imgur.com/wD1qXS3.jpg)

[AC Unit pre-cleaning](https://i.imgur.com/tHX3N8F.jpg). The panel where the corner isn't brown is where it is (was) seeping into the  basement.

[Basement top pic](https://i.imgur.com/9D8P6g4.png). You can see the dark spots where wood is wet. It is still dripping as of ~15 min later. 

[Basement bottom pic](https://i.imgur.com/GJxGpL6.jpg). The wire is old, unused heat tape. Wood panel used to be a stair. Top dirt is where the wet was coming in.

Some home info: Built in 1919. Been through lots of remodels. Recent repairs from previous owners were well documented. The foundation is stone. 

How fucked am I?
Blackout Curtain Options We just moved into a new apartment in a larger city and the rolling shades do not do a great job of blocking out the street light. Normally I would change out the shade, but being that we‚Äôre renting I‚Äôm not sure the property would appreciate it. I would hang some black out curtains but I‚Äôm in a bind with the way this shade is set up. 

Any ideas on what I could do here? I‚Äôve looked around on the internet but nothing suitable is coming up in my search. I‚Äôm wanting to hang something in front of them so we can still utilize the natural light when we aren‚Äôt trying to sleep.
New carpets but can feel spikes on the edge of carpet Hey, I just wanted to know if this is normal. So I just spent over 2000 pounds buying carpets and getting them fitted and when they left, they had left all of the cuttings and carpet tacks that were unused so I was clearing it all up when i noticed that there were spikes on the edge of one of the rooms. I went on to check and I could feel them around the edges of every room in the house. I'm guessing these are carpet tacks to keep the carpet held down but is this normal? I have a toddler so I am worried that she could get hurt if she presses her fingers down on the edge of the floor...
Is this corner area that's recessed in my shower pan a water weep/gap area? It was caulked after grouting. Should I remove that? 
Condenser Leak Issue For context I had a service appointment already today and my issue reappeared after they left, so I'm not opposed to calling a professional. 

Here's the issue- my condenser line runs from my unit in the attic (2 story house) down through my garage wall and then out at the bottom of that wall. There is a leak somewhere between the top of the first floor and the bottom of the attic. I know this because of visible water damage to the garage drywall I had already cut a hole in the garage drywall. Water is leaking by dripping off the header in the top of the garage wall and then dripping down from there. This issue was not occurring last summer. 

Service tech came today. Upon initial visual said there must be an issue with a joint of the pipe (PVC) somewhere. He then blew nitrogen (I think) to test the line to determine where the issue was. 

We went up to the unit and it appeared that a gallon or so of water was blown back up out through an exhaust portion of the line because the area around it near the unit was all wet. This led the tech to conclude that there was a clog which caused the water to back up and slowly seep out a joint somewhere. After running the air for 10-15 min there was no moisture present at the previous leak site and water was slowly draining from the line seemingly normally. Issue now resolved and we should get regular maintenance of the system, which living here now for 2 years, we haven't. 

Except, it's not resolved. After a few hours of use the leak has returned. My first inclination is to call the same company to come back asap. 

The other options we discussed were cutting into the wall on the 2nd floor to try to find the issue. The issue with this is because that wall has a floor to ceiling built in shelf/cabinet unit covering it, so none of the drywall is presently visible. So if there is a leak, I can't see it so we have to cut into the shelf unit just to try to find of the leak is present there. 

I asked about capping the existing line and extending the line to the exterior of the wall directly from the attic. This would at least stop sending water down this apparently faulty path. Admittedly I may to deal with some kind of water issue in the wall at some point. 

My only hesitation with calling the company back is I didn't love the 'settling up' part. Inspection service was quoted at $75. After doing what seemed like part of the inspection, they quoted me $260 for the service. I asked what this was for beyond the inspection and he said, 'ya know, labor'. Seemed opportunistic but I was feeling like this issue was resolved and I imagined it could've been much worse. 

So I'm considering getting someone else to take a look at the situation and see if there are any other possible options here. I was ecstatic that this was perhaps only a clog and the line was draining as normal. 

Am I being hard headed for not wanting to demo the built in shelf in the 2nd floor room to address this properly?
Bathroom vanities - one has green wood and other sink rusting? Hi there. I am thinking I need to redo my bathroom vanities. I think they are from the mid or late 80s. 

One of them (first pic) has green stuff on the wood. What is that?

The next two photos are from my other bathroom vanity. Is the sink rusting?

Do you think I can fix this or should I just redo everything? And do you think I need to redo just the sinks or the vanities as well?

I never thought I was going to be in this house as long as I have been and now it‚Äôs been 7 years so I‚Äôm thinking I should make some updates before selling. 

Thanks for your help!
How do I get a brick out of a sump pump pit? I have an outdoor sump pump pit in my backyard that had loose bricks around the edge. Last week I noticed a brick had fallen in on top of the pump. I tried to lift the pump out to grab the brick, but it managed to slide off into the bottom of the pit. The pump is now on top of the brick. 

The pit is about 7-8 feet deep, and 10 inches in diameter. Too deep to reach in, and too narrow for something like a rake or shovel to try and get under it. Any ideas on how to get this brick out?
AC unit retaining water I got a new HVAC system installed and they added this small pipe to connect to the pump. Yet there is water constantly in it and it seems like the pump isn't taking it all away. There hasn't been any back ups but should I be worried?
Repainting Porch In Rainy Climate My grandfather has been asking me all summer to repaint his 50+ year-old porch because its started peeling (originally done 2010ish, but he doesn't remember how or by who). I know that stain is better than paint, but he insists he wants it painted. The problem: it rains unpredictably and at least every 2-3 days where we live. I don't have faith the pressure wash will ever fully dry out. It'll likely get the primer and topcoat wet as well.  
Every time I try to google it, the results are just "Wait for a dry forecast!", which isn't helpful. Anyone have tips for how to get it to look good and hold up for a few years until I can pay someone with experience in our area to do it properly?
Estimate for adding a basement As the title says. My home has no basement. I really would like to have one because tornadoes are common in my area. I was wondering what it might cost to add a basement to a home without one and if it's possible. It does have a small crawlspace but I've never been in it. My home is listed at 1100 Square Feet. Any ideas?
Water softener/filter hissing noise Bought a home a little over a year ago and this recently started making a continuous hissing noise. Haven't messed with it at all, it runs a backwash cycle as normal daily. I'm confused on its purpose though because it doesn't soften the water; there's no brine tank hooked up to it. The previous owners confirmed it's not a water softener but that it "helps filter the water". Will it have to be cleaned or washed out or something periodically? I believe it was installed in 2018.

32 inch fridge w/features Hey everyone,

My mother has been looking for a new fridge but having trouble. She‚Äôs looking for something with a ice maker/filtered water dispenser on the door. However it needs to fit through her door, which is only 32 inches wide.

Is that combo quite rare or hard to find? I‚Äôm trying to help her out and a bit surprised at the difficulty she is having.

Thanks!
Massive gap between Trim. Painting the trim and the whole house but these gaps make the paint job look like a shit landlord special. Any idea how to fix it ?
Deck sealing It seems like a catch 22. If I pressure wash my deck thoroughly it gets down to the fresh green treated wood. Then because of those chemicals being exposed, whatever sealer I use does not like to stick to it. But of course you have to clean it thoroughly so the sealer can adhere. What am I missing? Also, what are the common sealers and types of people recommend?  I think I'll go with clear.

I‚Äôve recently put down a vapor barrier in my Crawlspace and now condensation from the ac is pooling on it. Is this enough to cause mold problems? The rest of the Crawlspace is very dry, I live in NC. Also, should this portion of the AC be insulated to prevent so much moisture? 
Air filter assembly incorrect? I'm about to leave town for a few days, and I was replacing my air filter before I leave. However, the airflow arrow on the new filter is the reverse of what I have always seen (is facing away from the mesh and in the direction of the pleats). I'm trusting my instinct, which tells me this is wrong, and the frame was just glued on in the wrong direction, but I want to be sure before I leave it unattended. Can somebody please confirm if what I'm thinking is correct? I'm open to me being wrong and this being done kind of special construction I'm not familiar with.
Recommendations/Advice for Cabinetry Vendor Hi! We are planning for a significant overhaul of our kitchen. Need advice on whether we should go for local vendors or a place like home depot/lowes to buy the new cabinets.

Issues with basement flooding during heavy rains  I've been having an issue with our finished basement getting flooded during heavy rains after we had our driveway paved. The driveway is slightly sloped towards our house (two garage doors and basement door). We have a trough drain that is installed in front of the doors that normally is able to collect all the water and send it to a storm drain. The trough drain can only move so much water and gets backed up during very heavy rains. The basement door is about 4'' above the lowest point of the furthest garage door, so we have to have about that much water sitting up against the garage door before the trough drain backs up enough to seep through the basement door. I'm not terribly concerned about getting a little water in the garage occasionally. Each bay has its own sewer drain.

Previously all of our downspouts were connected to the storm drain. I have redirected all of the downspouts out to the yard which has helped, but has not fully solved our issue.

I would really like some help coming up with ideas that do not involve regrading our driveway.

One thought that I have is to create an overflow channel (refer to photo 2) which would involve cutting out \~6'' of asphalt up along the foundation and putting some rocks or gravel to direct it to a collection point for a previously existing yard drain (the channel would be the yellow part in the photo). I had a landscaper suggest this would be a bad idea because water could then get up under the foundation of the house. In my mind we used to have gravel along the entire area and never had a problem with that, but I'd be curious to see what you all think. Thanks!

Why is it so hot in our condo? I‚Äôm trying to understand why it‚Äôs so hot inside our condo. During the day, it‚Äôs completely understandable, the sun hits it so it get hot.

But the issue is that‚Äôs it‚Äôs hot 24/7. It‚Äôs like the heater is on. It is currently 86¬∞ with the windows and doors open, outside it‚Äôs 69¬∞. It is 10:30pm, the sun settled over 2 hours ago.

Our condo building is facing West, with a unit behind us facing East. There is another condo building in front of us so around 6/7pm, the sun isn‚Äôt hitting our building anymore.

We are on the second floor. I‚Äôve verified that the heaters are not on, the only appliance that‚Äôs running is the fridge.

We have a portable AC, we tried running it and it struggles to get down to 80¬∞ but within minutes it jumps back up to 86¬∞ after turning it off.

We have a half vaulted ceilings, don‚Äôt know if that makes a difference or not.

We just don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs so hot or what can we do about it. 

For reference, the lowest temperature our condo reaches is 80¬∞ at 7am when the outside temperature is low 60‚Äôs.

Remodeling basement. My joists meet a framed wall leaving an ugly gap at the top - is there a solution that doesn‚Äôt impact the basements integrity like building a wood border ? 
How should I sister this joist? The joist is about 7 feet from where it butts against main beam to the blocking shown in the second picture. Total length is about 12ft. Can I sister to the blocking, or do I need to remove the blocking and sister the entire length? I only ask because getting a 12 foot board in that space above the garage door track is going to be a pain. And the split doesn‚Äôt yet reach the blocking. Thanks!

35sqm loft type house PH Hi. Would like to ask for your insights on this one. So my mom and I are planning on building a japanese style loft house in a 35sqm lot that was given to us. My concern was, I am the current breadwinner of our family and was wondering how much should I save to prepare on this. I'm just afraid the cost for this will be much higher in the upcoming years so I am also planning on getting a loan to be able to start it maybe this year or the next. However, my friend told be to hire a firm to do it and not just a foreman. How much do you think it would cost for the overall building of this house if I hire a firm?
Btw, the lot title was not yet transferred but it's not a problem. 

Thank you for reading and for your insights on this one.

Slow toilet tank leak w/ disintegrating valve seal gasket My toilet tank has recently started slowly leaking, and refilling every 20-30 minutes. This happened a year ago or so, and a new flapper fixed the issue, but it returned recently. I can buy a new flapper, but when I look in the toilet, I see there's a black gasket of some sort sitting around the flush valve that's falling apart (pieces of it flake off to the touch). It seems like that black gasket is blocking the flapper from making a tight seal, allowing the slightest bit of water to leak through (and eventually, causing the tank to refill)

I'm assuming I should replace that gasket first, but wanted to check here if that sounds right. And make sure to clean out the disintegrated piece really well so that the new gasket forms a good seal.  Here's some pics: [https://imgur.com/a/Ulr8Ez9](https://imgur.com/a/Ulr8Ez9)
What could this be used for? This ladder like object is on the underside of a porch roof, next to a pool.
The holes are not lined up.
You can't slide in something from the lower side.
The nails stick thru the roof, so storing pool noodles doesn't make sense either.  Not sure how they'd get there, but they'd get tore up.
You could hang sometime from the holes, but no reason for it to be built as one piece for that.
Any ideas?

Hello. Price to build my own 4x8 shed is roughly $350. On Amazon they have 8x6 kits excluding the floor for around $260. Thoughts? 
Bought our first home about a year ago. It‚Äôs not perfect but proud of the progress we‚Äôve made so far. Before/After
First time having a roof replaced. Overall looks great, but the flashing around the chimneys seems sloppy to me. Is this worth requesting they redo it or is this as good as I can expect? 
Is this Mold? If so, how big an issue is this? My wife and I live in a townhome built in \~1997 that we bought about 18 months ago. We recently hired a contractor to help us replace an old pedestal sink (probably original) with a new vanity. When the contractor went to remove the old sink, some tiles ended up coming up with it exposing a plywood floor beneath it. Our contractor thinks the builder may have used the plywood to elevate the floor, but he's not sure. Either way, it seems like the tiles were glued to the plywood and then grouted.

Originally, we were just going to look for a similar tile to fill in the gap left from the sink and forget about it since we hadn't planned on spending a significant amount of money in that bathroom but when my wife looked at one of the loose tiles she saw what looked like black mold on the back. **Is that actually mold or is it an adhesive of some type?** Our contractor did say that if there had been a leak at some point he would've expected the wood to warp and cause other tiles to crack or shift and as far as we can tell that hasn't happened.

If this is mold, next question is how concerned should we be? The bathroom is *very* small, but it does have a tub/shower. We haven't used this bathroom hardly at all since we moved in, but my wife is going to be moving her desk down there soon so it will be getting more use.

Any thoughts would be much appreciated!

Is purchasing a home in a trailer park a bad investment? Someone I know was looking into it seriously and then I was talking to another friend who had looked into it too. She told me that due to what you're actually getting for the money and the way taxes work make it a poor investment since you don't own the land, etc. 

What do you guys think? Also sorry if this is not the right sub to ask this in.

Edit: additionally, is it a better option than just renting if you can't buy an actual home?

Edit2: Thanks everyone. I think you've given a good and diverse amount of information to consider here. It's appreciated.

Lawn Mower Storage - Tips? Hey Reddit,

Just got a new property and don‚Äôt have the funds for a full shed storage option right now.

I am thinking about putting pavers down on my lawn and storing my riding mower with a tarp or mower cover in the back yard, the garage is too tight for the mower to stay there.

What is the best method for laying pavers? Dig out grass and soil, place gravel down, and then pavers? 

I want something that will disperse moisture and not sink down.

I am in Florida and the home is built on red/orange clay that is fairly compacted. 

Thanks for any tips!

Contractor price change: what can and should I do?  I am based in NJ

I've been working with a contractor to add solar panels, a generator, and replace the gutters on my home.

We worked out a quote and signed a contract.

Regarding the generator, they are now attempting to raise the overall cost by about 15% due to the location of the generator. Essentially, the hookups would require work not otherwise contemplated in the original agreement (according to the contractor).

I'd like to know what, if anything, my recourse is.

Some key facts (though I can add more if anyone has more questions):

* The contract signed has language that says "Generator/ Generator hook-up price given at the time of sale is an estimate only. Once the Site Survey has been completed, our electrician and plumber will review to confirm the installation site, location of all electrical and gas components and appropriate generator size".  

   * I did raise this, in email, with my sales person and was told the price is 99% accurate. Further, his manager originally said the price would stay the same.
* Throughout the process, the salesperson (in email) has gone with "the price is all-inclusive with no added or hidden fees" (paraphrasing here but I can find the actual text in email).
* With respect to the placement of the generator, there is no alternative placement aside from what's been proposed (my panel is on the corner of the house that's surrounded by the driveway).  

   * I did discuss this with the sales guy but I don't know if I have that in email.
Help w/ Pricing Basement Renovation I recently had my basement waterproofed. We had some efflorescence buildup on a concrete wall and all below grade walls were bowing inward by approx 2 inches. Two companies specializing in basement issues reviewed it and recommended sump pumps, which is what we went with. This also included putting a white canvas on most basement walls to prevent future water issues. I'm not surprised that the basement contractors recommended an expensive fix and I'm not 100% it was necessary, but what's done is done.

I now need to get the basement back to normal. This involves replacing flooring next to the walls, putting up woods slats on the wall, and some dry wall. I've attached pictures to this post. The ceiling is 8.5 feet. The walls that need work are 35 feet long, 12 feet long, 10 feet long, and 7 feet long, respectively.

I received a quote to complete the work for 30-35k. That is based on the estimated cost of materials, labor, and a 25% surcharge. I'm pretty surprise by this number. I thought the range would be 10-15k. Unfortunately, its the only quote I've received, so I'm having a difficult time gauging whether it is reasonable. Thoughts?

Oh, and I should mention that I have most if not all of the flooring material. The contractor thought most of it could be reused.

Smoke detectors going off. **TL:DR:** Smoke detectors going off throughout the house, without explanation. New batteries, fairly new detector units. Multifamily home. I live in Unit 2 and Unit 1 is currently unoccupied. I have lived in the house for just a month. Alarms mostly going off in Unit 1, which has a busted HVAC system (=hot and humid), but today started going off in Unit 2 (which has AC). Typically it has sounded for 3 beeps and then stopped. 

**Long version:** 

Smoke detectors started going off at random intervals in Unit 1 in the middle of the night a few days ago. I went down to investigate. No smoke. No carbon monoxide. Initially it was happening every 15 minutes or so. The frequency reduced throughout the night. It was hard to pinpoint if it was a particular detector, as several of them are connected. But it seemed to originate from different detectors at different times. The next day, I changed all the batteries, checked for debris, and tested each one. The alarms would still go off occasionally (every few hours). No alarms went off upstairs. 

The AC is not working in Unit 1, which has made it fairly hot and humid and has created some paint fumes. I brought in fans and an air purifier and opened windows in case this was causing the issue. This did seem to reduce the frequency, but it still went off once or twice over the past couple of days.   


However, an alarm in Unit 2 (where I live) also went off randomly today. Unit 2 has working central AC.   


The detectors are less than a year old: First Alert.   


Any ideas?  I have contacted the manufacturer's support, and requested an electrician come under my home warranty. 
Flooding How do I prevent my walkway from flooding every heavy rain?
Am I crazy to get rid of a sink? Picture this...1980s era 2 story 3bed 2 bath house getting a long needed facelift. The upstiars holds 2 bedrooms (including the master) and a shared bathroom off the hall with single sink. Both bathrooms have the same layout, left side has the vanity and toilet behind a privacy wall. Back wall has a window. Rght side has a storage closet and tub/shower niche. 


Downstairs has a single bedroom (guest/hobby space) and a hallway bathroom with a vanity and 2 sinks. This restroom gets alot of foot traffic during the day and when there are visitors they also use this bathroom.


 I think 1 large central sink would make more sense and make it more distinct from the upstiars bathroom. The large vanity will also have even more storage for us or guests this way. 


My husband has hesitations about removing a sink.
 What do you all say?
need advice on kitchen renovation and layout - peninsula or island for this space? cant figure out where to move the fridge Partner and I just bought our first home and the first thing we want to do is remove the wall separating the dining room and kitchen. The current layout is a little tight with the cooktop and oven being right next to each other and there isn't a lot of counter space. If we remove the wall, where would the fridge move to if we did a peninsula?

We‚Äôre trying to figure out if the space would work better with a peninsula where the wall used to be or if we should put an island in the middle.

Any suggestion is welcome with how to optimize the space! Thanks in advance!!

Dishwasher - Upstairs Upstairs Washing Machine failed, leading to some water damage. It was sitting in a metal pan with a drain but either the drain didn't work or couldn't handle a decent amount of water.

What is the code for upstairs Washing machines? Do they have to be in one of the metal pans? Should there be a trigger switch (I don't know the name) that detect water in the pan and shuts off the power to the machine?

Wanting to make sure things are put in correctly. I really hated the old metal pan as it looked disgusting. Can't really clean it and of course it gets dust in it since it's next to the dryer.
Can't Locate Source of Odor- Getting Worse Hey r/home, my wife and I are smelling an increasingly strong odor/smell emanating in our living room that is most noticeable just as we walk into our house from our garage. The smell either dissipates quickly or we acclimate to it quickly enough and stop noticing it. But it's getting worse/more pronounced. It showed up about \~4 weeks ago. The odor is foul (it smells bad). I'm not sure how to describe it other than is does *not* smell sour/acidity, but closer to poop (ew).

What I've tried so far: cleaning tablets for dishwasher/garbage disposal, using soap/bleach on kitchen/garage garbage cans, changing HVAC filter, checking crawlspace (just below living room) for water intrusion, feeling carpet/floors/ceilings for dampness, checking under sofas for food (we have small kids).

Any ideas on how else to troubleshoot the source of the smell? Appreciate your help!

Weird whistle What happened is me and my sister were chilling in room then this weird whistle started and we were really confused where it was coming from so we decided to see if its maybe from outside but when we opened the window the air from outside pushed the window and the whistle stopped.Now its happening again but the window is open and its like the window is opened somewhere else so the air is pulling the doors ,does this have anything to do with the fact that hood was on?because when we turned it off the pulling stopped but,this cant be the real reason right?because this never happened to us at home when the hood is on.

I hired some guys to paint the decks here and I am not happy with the work, but I am trying to decide if I am over-reacting I hired some guys to paint the decks here and I am not happy with the work, but I am trying to decide if I am over-reacting

I bought a place in the mountains and the decks are great, but in desperate need of TLC. I hired a small company to clean and stain the decks. 

It was over a year ago that we agreed on a price and scope of work: 
Clean roof (moss and algae buildup)
Clean decks (x5 small to large size decks)
Stain the same 
Pressure wash patios/ walkways 
Pressure wash house (siding, does not need to be painted)
Clean driveway (large, lots of moss buildup)

He said if I waited until the fall he would give me his best price so he could do it at the end of the season. 

This job has been dragging out due to weather, other jobs and me not putting pressure on him to do it now. 

He cleaned the roof and the patios, great work. (Last August)

He got part of the decks done and ran out of water. 

He texted me last week that they finally got up and finished the decks and he would be up this week to do the driveway. 

I came up to see the work and quarantine from my family since I just caught COVID for the first time, and I feel like the painting work leaves a lot to be desired, and I am trying to decide what I should do. 

It does not appear to me like the decks were adequately cleaned before being painted. He is coming by this afternoon and I suspect he is going to push back on me. 

Some pictures attached, would love feedback.

Repair Range Oven in New House Hello Everyone!  I just bought a new place and the 2 burners on the left side of the oven won't ignite but it is clicking.  When I removed the top I saw that the left side was missing the silver cap that is on the right side.  The left side is still sparking though, it just won't ignite the gas.  Is this just a matter of replacing the cap for the left side?  The oven is a Jenn-Air, I don't know the model.

Window AC unit questions Just moved into 1940s home, northeast US. It's been hot and humid for a while so we installed window AC units, which I've never used before. Units installed successfully (tilted down/away from the house, sealed gaps with foam and duct tape, screwed in, etc).

 I'm concerned about the health of the window sill, especially with how much it's been raining/hunid. Should I lower the storm windows onto the AC units and cover the sill or seal the sill from the outside? I'm thinking of getting on a ladder and just taping up some plastic to cover the exposed wood or something similar to prevent the window sill from collecting rain water, ideally in a way that doesn't block any of the unit's vents. I tried finding advice online and no one seems to mention this idea. Thanks in advance!
Cinder Block Repair We had central heat and air installed in our home when we moved in. The HVAC guy had to run new exhaust lines with the new system, and could not use the chimney from our 60 year old boiler. How would one go about fixing this?
Please tell me this is not water damage This is a home we have been slowly remodeling (mostly cosmetic). Last night I had to grab something and when I had the kitchen light on and I noticed the wall being extremely warped/uneven. When I turned on all the lights/during daylight, it was not noticeable. But it seems like it popped up over night. There is a bathroom right above the black section. The water to the tub has been shut off for months, toilet and sink are not but no one uses them, as the house is vacant. 
I talked to my mother-in-law who owns the house and she claimed it was like that from the beginning when they did a poor remodel 17 years ago but I honestly don‚Äôt think so. For clarity: I‚Äôm asking about the blue circle. The yellow circle is definitely a water spot I‚Äôm just not sure how old, I think I first noticed it last winter but it‚Äôs not getting bigger and the red line is approximately where the pipes run to the basement from the bathroom.
TIA

Carpet or no carpet on stairs? Hi all 
My parents are going to be staying with us for a few months while their home up the road is going to be renovated. They will have a bed and living area set up in our rumpus room downstairs. 
The stairs to access this room are probably on the steeper side. My thinking is that we should carpet them however my husband thinks that this could make them more slippery and more likely to cause a fall. 
We have added in a better hand rail. 
My parents are in good health but in their 60s. Please let me know if there is anything I could do to make it easier. Picture of the staircase attached!

Is this ok? Cooling upstairs seems to take forever in our house, and I think the main reason is the airflow to the upstairs is inadequate.

Fascia is this weird 45¬∞ molding. I need to do a ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù replacement. What is the best way to do this? I bought a fixer-upper house and my gutter are shot and need replacing. My roof still has a few more years on it and when the time comes for that replacement I plan on having the gutters,soffits, and fascia professionally replaced. In the meantime I‚Äôm doing a DIY on the gutters and fascia to hold me over for those few years since I‚Äôm currently strapped for cash with some of the other repairs that are more important and I can‚Äôt DIY (I‚Äôm pretty good with knowing my limits).

Does anyone have any ideas on what to do with these weird 45¬∞ fascia? Should I just replace and keep at 45¬∞? I wouldn‚Äôt use any molding and just keep it a smooth board and use my miter saw for the cuts. Can you bend gutter hangers like that?

Should I try to make them perpendicular to the soffit? If so what‚Äôs the best approach to that?
Back rooms hotter than front Hi all we have a 3bedroom 2 bath one story home. It runs off one line for the AC.

Plan of Attack with Frame Structure Damage Long story short my homes previous owner self installed a deck that has been secretly eating away at around 18ft of my houses frame. I'm in the process of obtaining quotes from carpenters in getting the previous deck removed and having the framing replaced accordingly.

What questions do I need to be asking besides the basic license and insured stuff. Does this repair need to be inspected by a local agent? Should I expect other issues besides the framing of the wall like in the roof trusses? For reference we stuck a tape measure 6 inches clear into the wall and was hitting the insulation and presumably the inner gypsum board. The ledger board? Gone and apparently never flashed properly! 

At this point I'm expecting anywhere from 15k to 25k in damage but want to be prepared for the worst. A simple older deck replacement has now turned into a nightmare to say the least. Am I missing anything major in my carpenter vetting process?

Solar company advice I just had a sit down with a rep from SunRun where we went over solar prices. Long story short, I just moved in, so I don't know our energy demands. But my wife and I both work 3-4 days per week, 12 hr days. I imagine our energy use is probably pretty high. 

‚óè$38k cash price, they don't do any maintenance.
‚óè$0 if we do a lease but then we pay them instead of the utility company
‚óè$28k of we pay the lease in a lump sum up front but would have 0 utility bill except what we use over what they provide, but they still do the maintenance and will replace the battery (10k cost) every 10 years. 

My questions are: 
1) is this price reasonable?
2) would you recommend SunRun?
How immediate of a fix does this need to be Hi all. First time home owner. Have had the house a little under year and recently started noticing the roof over one door has leaked. I believe this to be an issue from before I bought it that has gotten worse..Had some water damage, got a quote from a roofer to fix the leaks, but honestly need a whole new roof in the next few years and I want to add dormers in the back so I have held off fixing while I sort out logistics, get an architect etc.

However this summer has been crazy wet in the north east and I‚Äôm noticing the overhang is rotted. Soft to the touch, kinda gnarly. I don‚Äôt want to replace the wood without fixing the underlying issue of the roof and ideally I wouldn‚Äôt replace just one section of the roof if I‚Äôm gonna do the larger project soon. 

Given the rot, how much would this concern y‚Äôall. Immediate fix or can I hold off while I slam the gas and try to figure out the larger construction job.

Recurring Mice Advice Last year I opened my winterized house to find a pretty good mouse infestation, for the first time in 46 years of owning the home. 

I never had any luck with any kind of trap - sticky nor snapper. Always baited with peanut butter.   
The sticky ones had fur a few times but the critter escaped intact. 

I gave in and called an exterminator - $550 for traps outside the house on the ground floor + 2 follow up visits.   
I also tried hard to plug up all ingress.   
That seemed to do the trick.  


Fast forward to this summer, I've just found some mice droppings in the lower level of my house. Nowhere near the amount as before.

 The outside baits I had stopped refilling (to not attract new critters) but the baits inside (mostly in the ceiling) are still totally untouched. Since the original Exterminator visit I've only found the outside baits empty.   


I've moved some of the indoor baits to places near where I found the droppings.   
I'm also going to try one of the electrical zappers and something other than peanut butter.

Any other recommendations üôè?

Here are some pics of the type of mouse from 2 years ago :

Is this particle board moldy? So I smelled something that seemed like it was cigarette smoke coming from the wall (no one smokes in this house). Took the drywall down and found a hole at the bottom where I believe water was getting in and the insulation was dark like it was moldy where the hole was. Then I found more holes but these look like old intentional holes that were covered over but the insulation was dark around it as well. The particle board looks dark like it is moldy but none of the other insulation was moldy. Have you ever seen particle board look like this?

Certificate of authority and home loan Hello, 

We visited a house in Westchester County, NY, and liked it. The house is C/O ed for 1.5 baths but the current owner has extended to have two full baths. He has also done some work in the basement. Do you think a bank would provide a loan on such a property? we don't want to buy something that is not in the county's books, can we know some pointers on how long it takes to get C/O for new changes and what is the cost?

Thanks in advance for all the suggestions.
Super random but my floor is a little messed up, any tips? I hope this is an okay place to post this, i couldn‚Äôt think of where else it would go lol. So I was doing my nails and the container with my acetone was on the floor next to me, which I thought was fine, but I guess it had some on the bottom or something because now the coloring has been stripped from the floor where it was sitting. I was thinking I should try to find some kind of wood stain close to the original color but would that work? Any other ideas?

Wet seeping up interior basement wall We live in a rowhouse, and yesterday we noticed one of our interior walls in our finished basement is wet. It‚Äôs started at the floor and is moving up, but the carpet and concrete slab aren‚Äôt wet. The other side of the wall is our unfinished laundry room, so we can see that there is no plumbing behind the wet spot or above that wall. 

Our basement has a sump pump on the other side of the house, and an ejector pump for the basement toilet about 6 feet away from the wet spot. Our neighbors on both sides have shared that they‚Äôll randomly get sewage smells in their basement, and since we replaced our 40+ year old windows last month, we‚Äôve been smelling it too. 

Any ideas on what it could be or what kind of professional we should start with?

How screwed are we? My foyer/living room is one big open floor plan. there's two spots where it's an open doorway, one normal door size and one larger. There are cracks. They don't seem to be getting worse immediately but they're very noticeable. What causes this, how is it fixed and should we just tear the whole shit show of a house down and start over?
Should I replace these porch columns? Reposting here from /r/homeimprovement post, I don't know if that is the right place for this question. 

Hi, The columns on my front porch are bent outwards. They've been like this for 4 years or so. Should I have them replaced? My regular contractor said I'd need to hire a structural engineer to get an assessment and might have to add two more smaller width columns for support.

Question to the community, how soon should I look at fixing this?

Advice on flooring! We recently had a fridge leak and need to get our floors replaced. We had engineered wood floors and we are having issues choosing a replacement. Our budget is $11.49 sqf and we have two large dogs (one is 150 pounds and the other is 90 pounds) and two small children. We need something mostly water proof but aren‚Äôt sure where to start. Any advice from other homeowners? Thank you for any insight into all the options!
Based on the sound is this something to be concerned about (sound is a lot louder and deeper in person) 
Drywall problem, or worse? Very old house we recently moved into. These cracks have gotten slightly worse (over a year), but I'm thinking they may be superficial? Humidity this season has been fluctuating like crazy.

Is it ok to have a 10 gallon fish tank on this cutout? Hi all,

I‚Äôve actually had this filled 10 gallon fish tank placed here for a couple of years, it says a filled tank weighs about 110 pounds.  There‚Äôs a small crack in the corner of the drywall cutout where one of the pictures is, not sure if it‚Äôs due to the tank or just normal.  Attached is a pic of the framing of the cutout area.  

Is it reasonable to have the tank here?  Thanks
Patching a tear Hi all,

Thanks!

HVAC contractors We have small home and the summer PG&E bills have been sky rocketing lately. Moreover, the cooling in certain rooms is not working well, which we assumed was making the system work overtime. 

So we hired 3 contractors to inspect the home. The first was paid and  suggested a list of options including replacing/repairing the ducts because there were damages. Then the second contractor did a free inspection with a team of 5 people and offered to come replace all the ducts within the next week and for half the price. They also offered to do the asbestos removal themselves unlicensed to reduce costs.

I know this might sound out of line, but we really feel the cooling has gotten worse after the inspections. We used to at least feel a little air from the vents but now we feel none at all. We feel vulnerable because we are immigrants and new to everything about homes here. Was it naive to let these contractors walk around in our attics and crawl space for 30 mins -the day before a heat wave weekend?

Questions about AC duct sealing The previous owners of my house seemed like they were thinking about converting the back porch into an indoor area but never finished the job. There are 2 ceiling air vents out on the porch. The vents are closed with the built in lever to adjust the air flow but I can still feel a little air escaping through parts of the vents. 
First question, do you think the existence  of these vents is noticeably negatively impacting my ACs performance? Secondly, would something like those magnetic vent covers off Amazon be enough to reverse the potential negative impact or should I get the ducts capped off in the attic?
Rehanging Mantle? About two years ago we had a handyman install a mantle above our fireplace. About 2 months ago, it came crashing down. I have provided pictures for reference.

Solution for unneeded floor vents? I purchased a home in 2019 that had a new HVAC system installed and run through the ceiling. However, the home is older and used to be vented through the floors. 

There is significant air escaping through the floor vents (particularly bad in the middle of winter and/or summer). I have taken the registers up and covered the under-side to help with that. However, I also have 2 dogs and the registers are just traps for hair and whatever else my toddler drops in the floor. I have used magnet covers on the vents, but the dogs‚Äô nails slice through those with no problem. 

Some of the vents are broken and need to be replaced, but I don‚Äôt want to replace with an actual vent because I don‚Äôt need an actual vent! 

I have searched for floor vent covers with no vents but I‚Äôm not having any luck. Does anyone have a solution they might share?

Leaking sump pump discharge line. Pvc coupling, Check valve valve and pvc coupling This is my sump pump in the basement with few pvc couplers and a check valve.

Now, with the stronger pvc coupler and correct size, I tightened all the screws as well. But I still see leaking around this new coupler. Could you please suggest what else I need to do here to make this line leakproof. Thanks

Should I expect better from a $5500 floor refinish? This is the Bay Area CA so I know everything is more expensive than elsewhere, but I feel like the floor refinishing job I just got was not up to par and I could use some advice about understanding what went wrong. The images have captions explaining some of the problems.

The stain getting on door handles and baseboards is sloppy work. But I was most upset to see the stain wasn‚Äôt done under the fridge.  And I‚Äôm not sure what to think about the texture - it just feels tougher than I was expecting, and seems to have some kind of small bubbles or grit or something as depicted in the photos.

Have others experienced this with floor refinishing? I paid the guy before I was able to see the finished product (floor was still wet) and I think that was a mistake.

Foundation issue?

Water pouring between gutter & fascia Photos: [https://imgur.com/a/9D6bcOu](https://imgur.com/a/9D6bcOu)

We recently moved into a new (to us) home. The home itself is over 100 years old. I've noticed that during rainstorms, a *significant* amount of rain leaks between our gutters and fascia along 2 sides of our house (you can see in the photo. It's almost like the gutters aren't there). Roof was replaced approximately 5 years ago. Gutters are an unknown age, but are seamless (although feel like a material cheaper than typical aluminum).

I can see clearly minor warping between the gutter and fascia in several areas, along with some pretty botched miters at the corners. Can this be remedied by slipping in a larger section of flashing between the drip edge & gutter, adding some sealant between the fascia & gutter, and replacing the miters? Any other repair recommendations other than full replacement?

How should I fix this floor? We took down a wall to open up the kitchen/dining area and now need to fix the flooring. The difficulty is that this flooring is no longer made (can‚Äôt find a great match either) and it also lies on a transition piece with a minor change in height. We were considering taking flooring from an entryway (then would have to change the entryway) or a transition of some other sort (tile potentially). The gap is ~six inches wide and the entire length of the floor we would replace is ~8 feet). Looking for any ideas!
Weird smell in apartment My AC started acting weird and running out of Freon back in April. Since then, we‚Äôve had to refill the refrigerant 4 times and my landlord just replaced the evaporator coil which was leaking on Friday. It seems to be working fine but there is this lingering metallic/rust or garlic smell in my apartment that started at the same time? I don‚Äôt know if the two are related but can‚Äôt think of anything else that has changed since then. My apartment smelled normal when I moved in in January. Any ideas what might be causing it?
Basement Issue? House is about a year old - noticed what appears to be two wet spots forming on one of the basement walls. Is this a possible foundation leak?

Metal Front Door Doesn't Shut Properly 
Screws in the hinges all look tight and secure. It's a metal door (if it matters). And the part that seems to be sticking (paint rubbing off) is in the middle of the top half of the door.

We bought the house 5ish years ago, and the front door has always been a little difficult to shut, just at the door frame (on the knob side) before it is fully shut. We have not changed anything over this time (child lock came with the house), and it is now extremely difficult to shut to the point that my kid has messed up the door knob trying to shut it.

What's the best and/or easiest way to fix this? I was quoted about $5k to replace the whole entryway unit, but that seems like it must be a bit excessive for this issue.

Want to pave on side of house but this chunk of concrete is higher than level of driveway. Was this a repair to the foundation? Is there a way to level it out without damaging the foundation? Additionally There‚Äôs a vent in the crawl space that is completely covered by the concrete. This makes me think it was an emergency repair.
If it‚Äôs 100 degrees outside on a bright sunny day, and 87 degrees inside with no cooling except a window fan, is this a sign that the insulation is doing its job? It gets down to 63 at night. New old home, first summer living in it. We‚Äôre are planning to get mini splits installed this week, but I was curious if upgrading the insulation too would be worth it.

How Do I Get This Dry? Hi there. Just purchased the house and found mold less than a month in. Downsprout was draining on cement and running under stairs which got foundation moist.

How do I get this company dry and stay dry?

Is it safe to insulate around these wires? At the risk of asking a really stupid question, I‚Äôd like to insulate this gap in the ceiling above my boiler room which is exposed to the outdoors (heating oil) with ideally spray foam. My main concern is the cloth cable tat you can see in the second picture.  The cables inside are plastic sheathed and it appears like they are actually just low voltage cables to the thermostat (3rd picture). Any harm in spray foaming over that?  In lieu of that maybe just some fiberglass insulation?

UPDATE to WIBTA if I told my mom‚Äôs realtor the truth about her house This is a loose update but also a huge facepalm.

Small update: 
Realtor did find out issues. Some of the price got knocked off and they did find a buyer for the house.

Now for facepalm:
My mom and her husband Rick (fake name) are trying to move to Hawaii. It‚Äôs already blowing up in their faces though.

My mom and I don‚Äôt talk for many reasons but before I cut off contact, I had been trying to help her plan out their move better because her and her husband had 2 mortgages on their house and minimum wage jobs with no savings whatsoever so I was worried that if they didn‚Äôt wait a few years and save that they would have problems. My mom would tell me I was jealous of her and just trying to ‚Äúkeep her here‚Äù and that I‚Äôm negative and don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about. 

Fast forward to now, they didn‚Äôt plan this out **at all**. They both quit their jobs already and have already gone through most of their last paycheck/garage sale money. They‚Äôre supposed to be moved out of their house by the 31st so they can start closing, but they have nowhere to go.. they were originally going to go camping for a little bit, but now they can‚Äôt. 

They had originally rented a storage unit to store their stuff while they went over and found a house (that‚Äôs right, they didn‚Äôt even secure an apartment or house before selling their house, they also haven‚Äôt even bought plane tickets lmao. They didn‚Äôt plan anything at all) but anyways, they ended up taking their stuff out of storage and paying for a pod to put their stuff in to send to Seattle so they could ship their stuff over now (again, they don‚Äôt have a home yet)

Well, because they haven‚Äôt closed yet, because they *haven‚Äôt moved out yet*, they haven‚Äôt gotten the house money yet, and won‚Äôt until after they move out and close. 

Well they now don‚Äôt have enough money to ship the pod to Seattle. So according to my step dad (not Rick, I am close with my step dad, he‚Äôs my half sister‚Äôs dad) my mom told him that she‚Äôs not leaving the house until she gets the money and can ship the pod‚Ä¶ only, they can‚Äôt close until they move out.. idk what she‚Äôs thinking. 

Oh, also for extra ridiculous info‚Ä¶they haven‚Äôt even looked for new jobs over there yet. They‚Äôre going over there blind with no job, no house lined up, and all their stuff.. They also were going to try to sneak their cat and dog over so they didn‚Äôt have to quarantine them. 

I just don‚Äôt get it.

But I just repeatedly get told I'm wrong with no further elaboration. I would've been fine if he could provide a convincing argument against mine but he simply chose not to I guess.

It‚Äôs too easy to get guns in this country. This story happened a while back, but I didn‚Äôt put much thought into it until recently because everything was so chaotic at the time.

My dad has been to prison twice for a total of 9 years and is still on parole until next year. Being an ex-convict, my dad is not allowed to own firearms, but he got one anyway because he doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about the law, but this isn‚Äôt the dumbest part.

He asked my mom for a picture of her drivers license, and my mom trusted him at the time and assumed that it was for some kind of paperwork, so she sent him a picture without any questions. Later my dad sent her back a picture of the (I think)AR-15 he had just purchased in her name. I‚Äôm not a lawyer or an expert on guns, but an ex-convict just bought an automatic weapon with a PICTURE of someone else‚Äôs ID! He just walked in looking like the stereotypical ex-con that he is, showed a picture of someone else‚Äôs driver‚Äôs license, and bought an assault rifle. This can‚Äôt be legal right?
